The response also states the same price but does not provide details on the discount amount.\n\n2. **Companies Working with Coursera:**\n   - The response lists Christian Medical College Vellore, AAPACE, and Accenture as collaborators with Coursera. The third screenshot confirms these names appearing as partners. Other companies like Adobe are also visible in the screenshot.\n\n3. **Discount Information:**\n   - The response mentions a discount but doesn\u2019t specify the amount, and the screenshots do not provide information regarding the discount.\n\n### Evaluation:\n\n- The task successfully identifies the price and lists three companies.\n- The discount information is not specified or visible, leading to incomplete information.\n\n**Verdict: NOT SUCCESS**"
