    "reason": "To determine if the task was successful, I reviewed the provided screenshots and compared them to the task requirements. \n\n### Task Requirements:\n- Find a Mexico hotel with deals for July 25-26.\n\n### Observations from Screenshots:\n1. The screenshots show the Booking.com homepage with search options, but there is no specific search for a hotel in Mexico for the given dates.\n2. The calendar is set for 2025, which does not match the requested dates of July 25-26 (assuming 2024 or current year context).\n3. The response states \"No result,\" showing that no relevant Mexico hotel deals were found for the specified dates.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe task was not successful as:\n- There is no evidence in the screenshots of a search being conducted for hotels in Mexico for July 25-26.\n- The response confirms that no results were found.\n\n**Verdict: NOT SUCCESS**"
