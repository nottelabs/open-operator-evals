It seems the task conditions were not set correctly to search for hotels in Mexico for the required date of July 25-26, 2023. Additionally, no relevant results are shown in the screenshots. \n\nThe result response \"No result\" aligns with these observations, confirming that the task was not completed as instructed.\n\nVerdict: **NOT SUCCESS**"
