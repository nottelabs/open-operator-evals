The result response claimed to find the \"Chicken with Quinoa and Veggies\" recipe, but indicated a total time of 1 hour, with 30 minutes for both prep and cooking. This contradicts the requirement of under 30 minutes for prep.\n\nThe screenshots confirm the \"Chicken with Quinoa and Veggies\" was found, showing a total time of 1 hour (30 minutes each for prep and cook), upholding that the recipe does not meet the under-30-minute prep requirement.\n\n**Verdict: NOT SUCCESS**"
