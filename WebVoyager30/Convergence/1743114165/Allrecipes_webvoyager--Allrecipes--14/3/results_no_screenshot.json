The search results show recipes such as \"Chicken with Quinoa and Veggies,\" but the preparation times are not visible in the screenshots, which makes it unclear if any of them indeed require under 30 minutes.\n\nThe result response incorrectly states \"No result,\" as there were search results shown in the screenshot. However, the absence of preparation times leaves uncertainty regarding whether they meet the specific time requirement.\n\nFinal Verdict: **UNKNOWN**"
