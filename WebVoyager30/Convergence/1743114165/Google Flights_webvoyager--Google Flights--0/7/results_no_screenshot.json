They only show the CAPTCHA step, which suggests that the process was interrupted or incomplete.\n- The result response confirms that there are no results, aligning with the lack of information beyond CAPTCHA in the screenshots.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe task has not been accomplished as the journey details or pricing were not found or displayed. Therefore, the verdict is **NOT SUCCESS**."
