The page displays detailed information about how Google uses cookies for additional purposes that were previously optional, including fraud protection and improving services. The 'Accept all' button (mark_id 0) is now the final confirmation step.\nUseful Facts:\n- The final confirmation requires accepting additional cookie purposes for fraud protection, abuse detection, and improving services\n- The cookie usage includes developing and improving new services, measuring ad effectiveness, and showing personalized content\n\ud83e\udde0 We are making progress but need one final confirmation to complete the cookie consent process. We haven't yet reached Google Flights, so we need to complete this final step before we can proceed with our flight booking task.\nSince the page has updated to show the final confirmation dialog with our cookie settings, I will click the 'Accept all' button (mark_id 0) one final time to complete the cookie consent process. This should finally allow us to proceed to Google Flights and continue with our flight booking task.\n\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Actions: \n - {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"mark_id\\\": 0}\", \"name\": \"click\"}\n"
