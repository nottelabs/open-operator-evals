The result response indicates \"No result,\" but the screenshots show some hotel options.\n\nFrom the screenshots:\n\n1. **Hotel in East End, London**\n   - Price: $224 per night\n   - Meets the price requirement.\n\n2. **The BoTree - Preferred Hotels and Resorts**\n   - Price: Not shown\n   - Unable to confirm the price.\n\nThe screenshots do not provide enough information on the availability for the specified dates (July 25 for four days) or confirm the total price for the stay under $250, as only per-night rates are visible for one hotel.\n\nBased on the visible details and lack of information for the specified dates, the task is **NOT SUCCESS**. Only one potential option is clearly under $250 per night, and there are no details about the dates."
