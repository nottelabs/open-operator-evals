    "reason": "Based on the screenshots provided, the search parameters were correctly set for a stay in London for two adults in late July 2025. However, the response indicates \"No result,\" and there are no options visible in the screenshots that show any hotels fitting the specified criteria (under $250 for four days).\n\nHere's the evaluation:\n\n1. **Task Specification**: The task was to find at least three hotel options in London for two adults with a budget of less than 250 dollars for a four-day stay beginning July 25.\n2. **Execution**: The search fields in the screenshots were configured correctly with the location set to London and the correct dates selected for the stay.\n3. **Result Review**: The \"No result\" response indicates that no suitable hotel options matching the criteria were found.\n\nSince the result response matches the absence of information on the screenshots and no hotel options have been presented, the task is considered unsuccessful.\n\n**Verdict: NOT SUCCESS**"
