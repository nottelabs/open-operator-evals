    "reason": "To assess whether the task to investigate the trade-in value for an iPhone 11 Pro Max on Apple's website was successful, we need to determine if the necessary steps were completed and the information obtained.\n\n1. **Screenshots**: The screenshots show a CAPTCHA verification process on a website, which suggests that progress may have been halted due to this obstacle. There's no display of the Apple website or trade-in values for the iPhone 11 Pro Max.\n\n2. **Result Response**: The response indicates \"No result,\" implying that the information on trade-in value was not found or not provided.\n\nGiven this, the task was not completed as there was no successful navigation through the CAPTCHA or information retrieval from Apple's website regarding the trade-in value.\n\n**Verdict**: NOT SUCCESS"
