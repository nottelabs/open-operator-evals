Deleting removes it from the system, while unsubmitting returns it to the incomplete status. If there are issues, contacting arXiv administrators is advised.\n\n3. **Information in the Screenshots:**\n   - The fourth screenshot explains that if a submission is not yet publicly available, it can be deleted or unsubmitted using the Delete or Unsubmit icons. This aligns with what was provided in the result response.\n   - Additionally, for difficulties, contacting arXiv administrators is also mentioned.\n\nThe result response and screenshot information are consistent. The task has been executed correctly, and the necessary steps to withdraw an article if it has not been announced are clearly detailed in both the response and the final screenshot.\n\n**Verdict: SUCCESS**"
