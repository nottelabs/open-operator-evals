The result response provided a detailed explanation of the process for withdrawing such an article, and the screenshots confirm the information.\n\n1. The fourth screenshot displays the page titled \"Withdrawing an Article\" with a section called \"Submission not yet announced.\" It explains how to delete or unsubmit an article if it hasn't been publicly announced yet.\n\n2. The screenshots confirm that the correct section of the ArXiv Help contents was visited, as seen in the navigation through the Help Contents to the specific page discussing article withdrawal.\n\n3. Both the response and the screenshot indicate that if a submission hasn't become public, it can be deleted or changed to incomplete status for possible resubmission.\n\nBased on these findings, the task has been successfully accomplished.\n\n**Verdict: SUCCESS**"
