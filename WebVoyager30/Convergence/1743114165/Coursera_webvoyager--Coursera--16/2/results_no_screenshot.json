What other courses the instructor teaches.\n\n### Observations:\n\n1. **Course Instructor:**\n   - The result response states the instructor is **Xi Yang**.\n   - The screenshots show a Faculty & Staff Directory, but they do not provide any direct information about Xi Yang or his/her courses.\n\n2. **Other Courses Taught:**\n   - The result response does not provide specific additional courses taught by Xi Yang. It mentions unrelated faculty positions, such as \"Professor of Accountancy and V.K. Zimmerman Professor of International Accounting\" and \"Human Resource Generalist.\"\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- **Instructor Verification:** The claim in the result response that Xi Yang is the instructor is not verifiable from the screenshots provided.\n- **Additional Courses Verification:** The result response does not give relevant information regarding other courses taught by Xi Yang, and this aspect is not addressed in the screenshots either.\n\nGiven these observations, there is insufficient evidence from the screenshots to support the claims made in the result response. Thus, the task should be marked as **UNKNOWN**."
