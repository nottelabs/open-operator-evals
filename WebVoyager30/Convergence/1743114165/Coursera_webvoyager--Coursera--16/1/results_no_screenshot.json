These seem to be from a different website entirely (University of Illinois) and are unrelated to the task.\n\n### Evaluation:\n\n- The task specifies searching on Coursera, but no relevant search results were provided, and the screenshots do not support fulfilling the task's requirements.\n- There is no information about the course 'Introduction to Finance: The Basics' or its instructor in the response or the screenshots.\n\n**Verdict**: NOT SUCCESS\n\nThe task was not accomplished as instructed due to a lack of relevant results and information."
