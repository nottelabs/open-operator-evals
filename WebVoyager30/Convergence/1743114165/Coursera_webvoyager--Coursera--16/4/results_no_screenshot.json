The result response claims that Xi Yang also teaches other courses such as \"GIES 101\" and \"GIES 102\" at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.\n\nHowever, the screenshots do not contain any specific information about other courses taught by Xi Yang, so there's no visual confirmation of the additional courses within the provided screenshots.\n\n### Evaluation:\n\n- **Course Identification**: Successfully identified.\n- **Instructor Verification**: Successfully verified as Xi Yang.\n- **Other Courses**: Not verifiable from screenshots.\n\n### Verdict: UNKNOWN\n\nThe claim about the additional courses Xi Yang teaches (\"GIES 101\" and \"GIES 102\") is not verifiable from the provided screenshots. Therefore, the task is marked as unknown due to insufficient information on these additional courses."
