Substitute \\(x = 5.6\\) into the derivative equation: \\(2 \\times 5.6 = 11.2\\).\n\nGiven the instructions, the task is to calculate the derivative of \\(x^2\\) at \\(x = 5.6\\). \n\n1. The Result Response states \"No result,\" indicating that the task may not have been completed successfully.\n2. The screenshots show a CAPTCHA verification, suggesting that the process could not proceed past this point.\n\nThere was no derivation or substitution shown in either the Result Response or screenshots to demonstrate the calculation of \\(2 \\times 5.6\\).\n\nBased on this information, the task was not completed. Therefore, the verdict is:\n\n**NOT SUCCESS**"
