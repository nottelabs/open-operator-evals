The search was initiated, but there is no evidence in the screenshots showing that the wiki page was located.\n\n2. **Instructions to Change Theme**:\n   - The task also required providing instructions on changing the theme to \"agnoster.\" There is no information or result provided in the screenshots or the response.\n\nSince neither locating the wiki page nor providing the theme change instructions was accomplished based on the provided screenshots and response, the task is incomplete.\n\n**Verdict**: NOT SUCCESS"
