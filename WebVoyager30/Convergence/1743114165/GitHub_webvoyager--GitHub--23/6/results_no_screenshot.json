    "reason": "To evaluate the task, we need to verify two points:\n\n1. **Finding the Oh My Zsh Wiki Page on GitHub:**\n   - The screenshots provided show the navigation of a GitHub repository page, confirmed by the URL structure (`/wiki/Customization.md`). This likely indicates the \"Oh My Zsh\" wiki section on GitHub.\n\n2. **Instructions to Change Theme to Agnoster:**\n   - The fourth screenshot explicitly mentions copying the `agnoster.zsh-theme` file to your `custom/themes` directory. This is consistent with the result response instructions.\n\nThus, both aspects of the task have been addressed correctly.\n\n**Verdict: SUCCESS**"

Oh My Zsh is fully configurable to your needs with the help of the $ZSH_CUSTOM variable, whether you want to change its internals, plugins or the rich theme set \u2013 and all that without forking ! Initially $ZSH_CUSTOM points to Oh My Zsh's custom directory. Whatever you place inside of it will take precedence over the built-in configuration. Overriding and adding plugins Adding a new plugin Let's say you created your own plugin foobar and want to add it to your configuration. ~/.zshrc plugins=(git bundler foobar) Then, create a foobar directory inside the plugins folder and an initialization script to launch your plugin. This script has to follow a naming convention, as all plugin files must have an ending of .plugin.zsh . Your file tree should look like this: $ZSH_CUSTOM\u23ce\u2514\u2500\u2500 plugins \u2514\u2500\u2500 foobar \u2514\u2500\u2500 foobar.plugin.zsh Overriding an existing plugin Also follow these steps if you want to override plugins that ship with your Oh My Zsh installation. To override a plugin with a custom version, put your custom version at $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/<plugin_name>/ . For example, if it's the rvm plugin you want to override, create the directory custom/plugins/rvm and place a file called rvm.plugin.zsh inside of it. This method will override the entire plugin: your custom plugin files will be loaded instead of the files from the original plugin. Partially overriding an existing plugin To partially customize a plugin by redefining individual functions or variables from it, use a \"patch\" plugin. Create a custom \"patch\" plugin with a different name that has definitions for just the items you wish to override, and load that after the base plugin by putting your patch plugin in $plugins after the base plugin it customizes. (This is necessary because user custom files are loaded before any plugins are loaded.) Make sure it doesn't have the same name as any other base plugin, either. This may or may not work, depending on how the plugin is written: your redefinitions only take effect after the plugin has been loaded by source -ing its definition file.
