It mentions setting `ZSH_THEME` in the `~/.zshrc` file to change the theme. The specific instruction for the \"agnoster\" theme is stated in the result response: `ZSH_THEME=\"agnoster\"`. This was accurately reflected in the response, and additional configuration details like installing Powerline or Nerd Font are mentioned both in the response and the screenshot.\n\nThe screenshots and the result response are consistent, and all parts of the task were completed.\n\n**Verdict: SUCCESS**"
