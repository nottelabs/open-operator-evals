Therefore, the lowest is actually 1 star.\n\nEvaluation:\n- The task is mostly accomplished, with a discrepancy regarding the lowest percentage star level (response incorrectly states 2 stars instead of 1 star). \n- Since this crucial detail is incorrect, it affects the completion of the task.\n\nVerdict: **NOT SUCCESS**"
