The first screenshot shows information about a specific model with the license cc-by-sa-4.0 by a user \"juengose123,\" which has 0 likes.\n2. The second screenshot is a search results page with several entries, including \"juengose123/cc-by-sa-4.0\" and \"dkoterwa/kor-sts-cosine-embedding-loss.\" No likes are visible in these entries.\n3. The third screenshot provides details for \"albini1/jssp-soda-manufacturer,\" which also has 0 likes.\n4. The fourth screenshot is another look at the search results, showing the same options as the second one, again without any visible likes.\n\nThe result response indicates no result, which suggests no model with many likes was found.\n\nIn conclusion, the most liked model with the specified license is not identified in the provided screenshots or the response. Since no model with likes greater than zero was shown, the task is deemed not successfully accomplished.\n\nVerdict: **NOT SUCCESS**"
