    "reason": "To evaluate the task accomplishment, let's break down the information:\n\n### Task\nThe task is to find out when version 3 (v3) of the \"GPT-4 Technical Report\" was submitted.\n\n### Result Response\nThe result response states that the \"GPT-4 Technical Report\" was submitted on 29 April 2024.\n\n### Screenshot Analysis\nThe screenshots need to be reviewed to cross-check the date:\n\n- **Screenshot 1**: Shows a search result but no \"GPT-4 Technical Report\" with a submission date.\n  \n- **Screenshot 2 and 3**: These highlight the search function but don't contain the required submission information.\n\n- **Screenshot 4**: Displays two results: one paper is titled \"GPT-4 Technical Report\" submitted on 23 March 2023. This submission date could likely relate to v3, and it's visible in the screenshot.\n\n### Evaluation:\n- The response claims a submission date of 29 April 2024, but the screenshot shows 23 March 2023 for the \"GPT-4 Technical Report\".\n\n### Verdict\nThe screenshots do not support the date stated in the result response. The accurate submission date for the \"GPT-4 Technical Report\" as per the screenshot is 23 March 2023. Thus, the information provided in the response is incorrect.\n\n**NOT SUCCESS**"
