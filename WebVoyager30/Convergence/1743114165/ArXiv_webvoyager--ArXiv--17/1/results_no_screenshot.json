The search query \"GPT-4 Technical Report\" is visible in the screenshots.\n2. The paper shown in the search results is not the actual \"GPT-4 Technical Report\" but another paper titled \"Predicting Large Language Model Capabilities on Closed-Book QA Tasks Using Only Information Available Prior to Training.\"\n3. There is no indication of a version 3 (v3) or its submission date in any of the provided screenshots.\n\nThe result response also indicates \"No result,\" suggesting that the specific paper and version were not found.\n\nBased on these observations, the task to find the submission date for version 3 was not accomplished.\n\n**Verdict: NOT SUCCESS**"
