    "reason": "To determine whether the task was successful, let's analyze the instructions and results.\n\n**Task:** Find the paper 'GPT-4 Technical Report', and determine when version 3 (v3) was submitted.\n\n**Screenshots Analysis:**\nFrom the screenshots provided:\n\n1. The search query entered was \"OpenAI GPT-4 or GPT-4 technical report,\" which returned results related to GPT-4.\n2. The first result listed is titled \"Predicting Large Language Model Capabilities on Closed-Book QA Tasks Using Only Information Available Prior to Training,\" and it mentions the \"GPT-4 technical report\" in the abstract.\n3. The submission date visible is 6 February 2025 for this document, identified with the arXiv ID: arXiv:2502.04066.\n\n**Result Response:** The result response was \"No result,\" which means it did not provide information about v3's submission date.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe screenshots do not provide information specifically about the submission date of version 3 (v3) of the \"GPT-4 Technical Report.\" The task required finding when this specific version was submitted, which wasn't accomplished. The visible information refers only to the general submission date of the document related to GPT-4.\n\n**Verdict:** NOT SUCCESS"
