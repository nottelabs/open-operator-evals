(M4) starts at $999 or $83.25 per month.\n   - MacBook Air 15-in. (M4) starts at $1199 or $99.91 per month.\n   - MacBook Air 15-in. (M3) starts at $2499 or $208.25 per month.\n\n2. **Screenshots:**\n   - The fourth screenshot shows:\n     - MacBook Air 13-in. (M4) starting at $999 or $83.25/month.\n     - MacBook Air 15-in. (M4) starting at $1199 or $99.91/month.\n   - No mention or price for MacBook Air 15-in. (M3) is visible.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The information from the screenshots aligns with the response for the MacBook Air 13-in. (M4) and MacBook Air 15-in. (M4).\n- There is no evidence in the screenshots supporting the price for the MacBook Air 15-in. (M3) as mentioned in the response.\n\n**Verdict:**\nThe task was partially completed, as only two of the three models mentioned are verified by the screenshots. The absence of information substantiating the MacBook Air 15-in. (M3) makes the task **NOT SUCCESSFUL**."
