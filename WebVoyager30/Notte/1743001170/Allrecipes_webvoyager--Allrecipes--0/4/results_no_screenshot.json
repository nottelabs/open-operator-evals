Cook lasagna in the same boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.\n4. Mix spinach, ricotta cheese, 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, egg, nutmeg, basil, salt, and black pepper in a bowl until well combined.\n5. Spread 1/4 cup pasta sauce on the bottom of the prepared casserole dish. Top with 3 lasagna noodles, 1/2 of the ricotta-egg mixture, and 1/4 cup pasta sauce. Repeat layers of 3 more noodles, 1/2 cup ricotta-egg mixture, and 1/4 cup pasta sauce. End with remaining 3 noodles and 1/4 cup pasta sauce. Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese. Top with Parmesan cheese. Cover casserole with aluminum foil.\n6. Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Uncover casserole and continue baking until lasagna is bubbling and lightly browned, about 25 more minutes. Let lasagna stand 5 minutes before serving.",

ACTIONS: You are only allowed to chose one single action from the list to be executed.\n\nYou will find below some common actions sequences so that you can undertand the flow of some tasks.\nIDS presented in those sequences correspond to interactionable elements found in the page.\nYou might encounter the same ids, but never assume them to exist, or have the same role.\n\n   Common action sequences:\n   - Form filling:\n```json\n[\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I99\", \"value\": \"username\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I101\", \"value\": \"password\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"click\": {\"id\": \"B1\"}}\n]\n```\n   - Navigation and extraction:\n```json\n[\n  {\"goto\": {\"url\": \"https://www.google.com\"}},\n  {\"scrape\": {\"instructions\": null}}\n]\n```\n\nREMEMBER: You are NEVER allowed to specify multiple actions in the list of actions.\n\n\n3. ELEMENT INTERACTION:\n   - Only use `ids` that exist in the provided element list\n   - Each element has a unique `id` (e.g., `I2[:]<button>`)\n   - Elements marked with `_[:]` are non-interactive (for context only)\n\n4. NAVIGATION & ERROR HANDLING:\n   - If no suitable elements exist, use other functions to complete the task\n   - If stuck, try alternative approaches\n   - Handle popups/cookies by accepting or closing them\n   - Use scroll to find elements you are looking for\n\n5. TASK COMPLETION:\n   - Use the `completion` action as the last action as soon as the task is complete\n   - Don't hallucinate actions\n   - If the task requires specific information - make sure to include everything in the `completion` function. This is what the user will see.\n   - If you are running out of steps (current step), think about speeding it up, and ALWAYS use the `completion` action as the last action.\n   - Note that the `completion` can fail because an external validator failed to validate the output. If this happens, you should reflect on why the output is invalid and try to fix it.\n\n   - Example of sucessfuly `completion` action:\n```json\n[\n  {\"completion\": {\"success\": true, \"answer\": \"<answer to the task>\"}}\n]\n```\n\n6. VISUAL CONTEXT:\n   - When an image is provided, use it to understand the page layout\n   - Bounding boxes with labels correspond to element indexes\n   - Each bounding box and its label have the same color\n   - Most often the label is inside the bounding box, on the top right\n   - Visual context helps verify element locations and relationships\n   - sometimes labels overlap, so use the context to verify the correct element\n\n7. Form filling:\n   - If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often a list with suggestions popped up under the field and you need to first select the right element from the suggestion list.\n\n8. ACTION SEQUENCING:\n   - Actions are executed in the order they appear in the list\n   - Each action should logically follow from the previous one\n   - If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.\n   - If content only disappears the sequence continues.\n   - Only provide the action sequence until you think the page will change.\n   - Try to be efficient, e.g. fill forms at once, or chain actions where nothing changes on the page like saving, extracting, checkboxes...\n   - NEVER use multiple actions in a single step (otherwise ONLY the first action will be executed)\n\n9. Long tasks:\n- If the task is long keep track of the status in the memory. If the ultimate task requires multiple subinformation, keep track of the status in the memory\n\nFunctions:\n\n* \"check\" : Check a checkbox. Use `True` to check, `False` to uncheck.

Format:\n```json\n{\"wait\": {\"time_ms\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"reload\" : Reload the current page. Format:\n```json\n{\"reload\": {}}\n```\n\n* \"scrape\" : Scrape the current page data in text format. If `instructions` is null then the whole page will be scraped. Otherwise, only the data that matches the instructions will be scraped. Instructions should be given as natural language, e.g. 'Extract the title and the price of the product'. Format:\n```json\n{\"scrape\": {\"instructions\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"fill\" : Fill an input field with a value. Format:\n```json\n{\"fill\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"value\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"clear_before_fill\": {\"default\": true, \"type\": \"boolean\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"go_forward\" : Go forward to the next page (in current tab). Format:\n```json\n{\"go_forward\": {}}\n```\n\n\nRemember: Your responses must be valid JSON matching the specified format. Each action in the sequence must be valid.\n"

Analyze the provided webpage elements and structure\n2. Plan a sequence of actions to accomplish the given task\n3. Respond with valid JSON containing your action sequence and state assessment\n\nCurrent date and time: 2025-03-26 16:01:36\n\nINPUT STRUCTURE:\n1. Current URL: The webpage you're currently on\n2. Available Tabs: List of open browser tabs\n3. Interactive Elements: List in the format:\n   id[:]<element_type>element_text</element_type>\n   - `id`: identifier for interaction. `ids` can be decomposed into `<role_first_letter><index>[:]` where `<index>` is the index of the element in the list of elements with the same role and `<role_first_letter>` are:\n        - `I` for input fields (textbox, select, checkbox, etc.)\n        - `B` for buttons\n        - `L` for links\n        - `F` for figures and images\n        - `O` for options in select elements\n        - `M` for miscallaneous elements (e.g. modals, dialogs, etc.) that are only clickable for the most part.\n   - `element_type`: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)\n   - `element_text`: Visible text or element description\n\nExample:\nB1[:]<button>Submit Form</button>\n_[:] Non-interactive text\n\n\nNotes:\n- Only elements with `ids` are interactive\n- `_[:]` elements provide context but cannot be interacted with\n\n1. RESPONSE FORMAT: You must ALWAYS respond with valid JSON in this exact format:\n```json\n\n{\n  \"state\": {\n    \"page_summary\": \"On the page are company a,b,c wtih their revenue 1,2,3.\",\n    \"relevant_interactions\": [{\"id\": \"B2\", \"reason\": \"The button with id B2 represents search and I'm looking to search\"}],\n    \"previous_goal_status\": \"success|failure|unknown\",\n    \"previous_goal_eval\": \"Analyze the current elements and the image to check if the previous goals/actions are successful like intended by the task. Ignore the action result. The website is the ground truth. Also mention if something unexpected happened like new suggestions in an input field. Shortly state why/why not\",\n    \"memory\": \"Description of what has been done and what you need to remember until the end of the task\",\n    \"next_goal\": \"What needs to be done with the next actions\"\n  },\n  \"actions\": [\n   { \"one_action_name\": {\n      // action-specific parameter\n      ...\n   }\n   }, // ... more actions in sequence ...\n  ]\n}\n\n```\n\n\n2. ACTIONS: You are only allowed to chose one single action from the list to be executed.\n\nYou will find below some common actions sequences so that you can undertand the flow of some tasks.\nIDS presented in those sequences correspond to interactionable elements found in the page.\nYou might encounter the same ids, but never assume them to exist, or have the same role.\n\n   Common action sequences:\n   - Form filling:\n```json\n[\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I99\", \"value\": \"username\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I101\", \"value\": \"password\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"click\": {\"id\": \"B1\"}}\n]\n```\n   - Navigation and extraction:\n```json\n[\n  {\"goto\": {\"url\": \"https://www.google.com\"}},\n  {\"scrape\": {\"instructions\": null}}\n]\n```\n\nREMEMBER: You are NEVER allowed to specify multiple actions in the list of actions.\n\n\n3. ELEMENT INTERACTION:\n   - Only use `ids` that exist in the provided element list\n   - Each element has a unique `id` (e.g., `I2[:]<button>`)\n   - Elements marked with `_[:]` are non-interactive (for context only)\n\n4. NAVIGATION & ERROR HANDLING:\n   - If no suitable elements exist, use other functions to complete the task\n   - If stuck, try alternative approaches\n   - Handle popups/cookies by accepting or closing them\n   - Use scroll to find elements you are looking for\n\n5. TASK COMPLETION:\n   - Use the `completion` action as the last action as soon as the task is complete\n   - Don't hallucinate actions\n   - If the task requires specific information - make sure to include everything in the `completion` function. This is what the user will see.\n   - If you are running out of steps (current step), think about speeding it up, and ALWAYS use the `completion` action as the last action.\n   - Note that the `completion` can fail because an external validator failed to validate the output. If this happens, you should reflect on why the output is invalid and try to fix it.\n\n   - Example of sucessfuly `completion` action:\n```json\n[\n  {\"completion\": {\"success\": true, \"answer\": \"<answer to the task>\"}}\n]\n```\n\n6. VISUAL CONTEXT:\n   - When an image is provided, use it to understand the page layout\n   - Bounding boxes with labels correspond to element indexes\n   - Each bounding box and its label have the same color\n   - Most often the label is inside the bounding box, on the top right\n   - Visual context helps verify element locations and relationships\n   - sometimes labels overlap, so use the context to verify the correct element\n\n7. Form filling:\n   - If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often a list with suggestions popped up under the field and you need to first select the right element from the suggestion list.\n\n8. ACTION SEQUENCING:\n   - Actions are executed in the order they appear in the list\n   - Each action should logically follow from the previous one\n   - If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.\n   - If content only disappears the sequence continues.\n   - Only provide the action sequence until you think the page will change.\n   - Try to be efficient, e.g. fill forms at once, or chain actions where nothing changes on the page like saving, extracting, checkboxes...\n   - NEVER use multiple actions in a single step (otherwise ONLY the first action will be executed)\n\n9. Long tasks:\n- If the task is long keep track of the status in the memory. If the ultimate task requires multiple subinformation, keep track of the status in the memory\n\nFunctions:\n\n* \"check\" : Check a checkbox. Use `True` to check, `False` to uncheck. Format:\n```json\n{\"check\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"value\": {\"type\": \"boolean\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"switch_tab\" : Switch to a tab (identified by its index). Format:\n```json\n{\"switch_tab\": {\"tab_index\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"go_back\" : Go back to the previous page (in current tab). Format:\n```json\n{\"go_back\": {}}\n```\n\n* \"completion\" : Complete the task by returning the answer and terminate the browser session. Format:\n```json\n{\"completion\": {\"success\": {\"type\": \"boolean\"}, \"answer\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"goto_new_tab\" : Goto to a URL (in new tab). Format:\n```json\n{\"goto_new_tab\": {\"url\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"goto\" : Goto to a URL (in current tab). Format:\n```json\n{\"goto\": {\"url\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"select_dropdown_option\" : Select an option from a dropdown. The `id` field should be set to the select element's id. Then you can either set the `value` field to the option's text or the `option_id` field to the option's `id`.. Format:\n```json\n{\"select_dropdown_option\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"option_id\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}, \"value\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"scroll_up\" : Scroll up by a given amount of pixels. Use `null` for scrolling up one page. Format:\n```json\n{\"scroll_up\": {\"amount\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"integer\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"click\" : Click on an element of the current page. Format:\n```json\n{\"click\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"list_dropdown_options\" : List all options of a dropdown. Format:\n```json\n{\"list_dropdown_options\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"press_key\" : Press a keyboard key: e.g. 'Enter', 'Backspace', 'Insert', 'Delete', etc.. Format:\n```json\n{\"press_key\": {\"key\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"scroll_down\" : Scroll down by a given amount of pixels. Use `null` for scrolling down one page. Format:\n```json\n{\"scroll_down\": {\"amount\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"integer\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"wait\" : Wait for a given amount of time (in milliseconds). Format:\n```json\n{\"wait\": {\"time_ms\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"reload\" : Reload the current page. Format:\n```json\n{\"reload\": {}}\n```\n\n* \"scrape\" : Scrape the current page data in text format. If `instructions` is null then the whole page will be scraped. Otherwise, only the data that matches the instructions will be scraped. Instructions should be given as natural language, e.g. 'Extract the title and the price of the product'. Format:\n```json\n{\"scrape\": {\"instructions\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"fill\" : Fill an input field with a value. Format:\n```json\n{\"fill\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"value\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"clear_before_fill\": {\"default\": true, \"type\": \"boolean\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"go_forward\" : Go forward to the next page (in current tab). Format:\n```json\n{\"go_forward\": {}}\n```\n\n\nRemember: Your responses must be valid JSON matching the specified format. Each action in the sequence must be valid.\n"

Analyze the provided webpage elements and structure\n2. Plan a sequence of actions to accomplish the given task\n3. Respond with valid JSON containing your action sequence and state assessment\n\nCurrent date and time: 2025-03-26 16:01:41\n\nINPUT STRUCTURE:\n1. Current URL: The webpage you're currently on\n2. Available Tabs: List of open browser tabs\n3. Interactive Elements: List in the format:\n   id[:]<element_type>element_text</element_type>\n   - `id`: identifier for interaction. `ids` can be decomposed into `<role_first_letter><index>[:]` where `<index>` is the index of the element in the list of elements with the same role and `<role_first_letter>` are:\n        - `I` for input fields (textbox, select, checkbox, etc.)\n        - `B` for buttons\n        - `L` for links\n        - `F` for figures and images\n        - `O` for options in select elements\n        - `M` for miscallaneous elements (e.g. modals, dialogs, etc.) that are only clickable for the most part.\n   - `element_type`: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)\n   - `element_text`: Visible text or element description\n\nExample:\nB1[:]<button>Submit Form</button>\n_[:] Non-interactive text\n\n\nNotes:\n- Only elements with `ids` are interactive\n- `_[:]` elements provide context but cannot be interacted with\n\n1. RESPONSE FORMAT: You must ALWAYS respond with valid JSON in this exact format:\n```json\n\n{\n  \"state\": {\n    \"page_summary\": \"On the page are company a,b,c wtih their revenue 1,2,3.\",\n    \"relevant_interactions\": [{\"id\": \"B2\", \"reason\": \"The button with id B2 represents search and I'm looking to search\"}],\n    \"previous_goal_status\": \"success|failure|unknown\",\n    \"previous_goal_eval\": \"Analyze the current elements and the image to check if the previous goals/actions are successful like intended by the task. Ignore the action result. The website is the ground truth. Also mention if something unexpected happened like new suggestions in an input field. Shortly state why/why not\",\n    \"memory\": \"Description of what has been done and what you need to remember until the end of the task\",\n    \"next_goal\": \"What needs to be done with the next actions\"\n  },\n  \"actions\": [\n   { \"one_action_name\": {\n      // action-specific parameter\n      ...\n   }\n   }, // ... more actions in sequence ...\n  ]\n}\n\n```\n\n\n2. ACTIONS: You are only allowed to chose one single action from the list to be executed.\n\nYou will find below some common actions sequences so that you can undertand the flow of some tasks.\nIDS presented in those sequences correspond to interactionable elements found in the page.\nYou might encounter the same ids, but never assume them to exist, or have the same role.\n\n   Common action sequences:\n   - Form filling:\n```json\n[\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I99\", \"value\": \"username\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I101\", \"value\": \"password\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"click\": {\"id\": \"B1\"}}\n]\n```\n   - Navigation and extraction:\n```json\n[\n  {\"goto\": {\"url\": \"https://www.google.com\"}},\n  {\"scrape\": {\"instructions\": null}}\n]\n```\n\nREMEMBER: You are NEVER allowed to specify multiple actions in the list of actions.\n\n\n3. ELEMENT INTERACTION:\n   - Only use `ids` that exist in the provided element list\n   - Each element has a unique `id` (e.g., `I2[:]<button>`)\n   - Elements marked with `_[:]` are non-interactive (for context only)\n\n4. NAVIGATION & ERROR HANDLING:\n   - If no suitable elements exist, use other functions to complete the task\n   - If stuck, try alternative approaches\n   - Handle popups/cookies by accepting or closing them\n   - Use scroll to find elements you are looking for\n\n5. TASK COMPLETION:\n   - Use the `completion` action as the last action as soon as the task is complete\n   - Don't hallucinate actions\n   - If the task requires specific information - make sure to include everything in the `completion` function. This is what the user will see.\n   - If you are running out of steps (current step), think about speeding it up, and ALWAYS use the `completion` action as the last action.\n   - Note that the `completion` can fail because an external validator failed to validate the output. If this happens, you should reflect on why the output is invalid and try to fix it.\n\n   - Example of sucessfuly `completion` action:\n```json\n[\n  {\"completion\": {\"success\": true, \"answer\": \"<answer to the task>\"}}\n]\n```\n\n6. VISUAL CONTEXT:\n   - When an image is provided, use it to understand the page layout\n   - Bounding boxes with labels correspond to element indexes\n   - Each bounding box and its label have the same color\n   - Most often the label is inside the bounding box, on the top right\n   - Visual context helps verify element locations and relationships\n   - sometimes labels overlap, so use the context to verify the correct element\n\n7. Form filling:\n   - If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often a list with suggestions popped up under the field and you need to first select the right element from the suggestion list.\n\n8. ACTION SEQUENCING:\n   - Actions are executed in the order they appear in the list\n   - Each action should logically follow from the previous one\n   - If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.\n   - If content only disappears the sequence continues.\n   - Only provide the action sequence until you think the page will change.\n   - Try to be efficient, e.g. fill forms at once, or chain actions where nothing changes on the page like saving, extracting, checkboxes...\n   - NEVER use multiple actions in a single step (otherwise ONLY the first action will be executed)\n\n9. Long tasks:\n- If the task is long keep track of the status in the memory. If the ultimate task requires multiple subinformation, keep track of the status in the memory\n\nFunctions:\n\n* \"check\" : Check a checkbox. Use `True` to check, `False` to uncheck. Format:\n```json\n{\"check\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"value\": {\"type\": \"boolean\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"switch_tab\" : Switch to a tab (identified by its index). Format:\n```json\n{\"switch_tab\": {\"tab_index\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"go_back\" : Go back to the previous page (in current tab). Format:\n```json\n{\"go_back\": {}}\n```\n\n* \"completion\" : Complete the task by returning the answer and terminate the browser session. Format:\n```json\n{\"completion\": {\"success\": {\"type\": \"boolean\"}, \"answer\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"goto_new_tab\" : Goto to a URL (in new tab). Format:\n```json\n{\"goto_new_tab\": {\"url\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"goto\" : Goto to a URL (in current tab). Format:\n```json\n{\"goto\": {\"url\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"select_dropdown_option\" : Select an option from a dropdown. The `id` field should be set to the select element's id. Then you can either set the `value` field to the option's text or the `option_id` field to the option's `id`.. Format:\n```json\n{\"select_dropdown_option\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"option_id\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}, \"value\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"scroll_up\" : Scroll up by a given amount of pixels. Use `null` for scrolling up one page. Format:\n```json\n{\"scroll_up\": {\"amount\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"integer\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"click\" : Click on an element of the current page. Format:\n```json\n{\"click\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"list_dropdown_options\" : List all options of a dropdown. Format:\n```json\n{\"list_dropdown_options\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"press_key\" : Press a keyboard key: e.g. 'Enter', 'Backspace', 'Insert', 'Delete', etc.. Format:\n```json\n{\"press_key\": {\"key\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"scroll_down\" : Scroll down by a given amount of pixels. Use `null` for scrolling down one page. Format:\n```json\n{\"scroll_down\": {\"amount\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"integer\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"wait\" : Wait for a given amount of time (in milliseconds). Format:\n```json\n{\"wait\": {\"time_ms\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"reload\" : Reload the current page. Format:\n```json\n{\"reload\": {}}\n```\n\n* \"scrape\" : Scrape the current page data in text format. If `instructions` is null then the whole page will be scraped. Otherwise, only the data that matches the instructions will be scraped. Instructions should be given as natural language, e.g. 'Extract the title and the price of the product'. Format:\n```json\n{\"scrape\": {\"instructions\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"fill\" : Fill an input field with a value. Format:\n```json\n{\"fill\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"value\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"clear_before_fill\": {\"default\": true, \"type\": \"boolean\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"go_forward\" : Go forward to the next page (in current tab). Format:\n```json\n{\"go_forward\": {}}\n```\n\n\nRemember: Your responses must be valid JSON matching the specified format. Each action in the sequence must be valid.\n"

Interactive Elements: List in the format:\n   id[:]<element_type>element_text</element_type>\n   - `id`: identifier for interaction. `ids` can be decomposed into `<role_first_letter><index>[:]` where `<index>` is the index of the element in the list of elements with the same role and `<role_first_letter>` are:\n        - `I` for input fields (textbox, select, checkbox, etc.)\n        - `B` for buttons\n        - `L` for links\n        - `F` for figures and images\n        - `O` for options in select elements\n        - `M` for miscallaneous elements (e.g. modals, dialogs, etc.) that are only clickable for the most part.\n   - `element_type`: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)\n   - `element_text`: Visible text or element description\n\nExample:\nB1[:]<button>Submit Form</button>\n_[:] Non-interactive text\n\n\nNotes:\n- Only elements with `ids` are interactive\n- `_[:]` elements provide context but cannot be interacted with\n\n1. RESPONSE FORMAT: You must ALWAYS respond with valid JSON in this exact format:\n```json\n\n{\n  \"state\": {\n    \"page_summary\": \"On the page are company a,b,c wtih their revenue 1,2,3.\",\n    \"relevant_interactions\": [{\"id\": \"B2\", \"reason\": \"The button with id B2 represents search and I'm looking to search\"}],\n    \"previous_goal_status\": \"success|failure|unknown\",\n    \"previous_goal_eval\": \"Analyze the current elements and the image to check if the previous goals/actions are successful like intended by the task. Ignore the action result. The website is the ground truth. Also mention if something unexpected happened like new suggestions in an input field. Shortly state why/why not\",\n    \"memory\": \"Description of what has been done and what you need to remember until the end of the task\",\n    \"next_goal\": \"What needs to be done with the next actions\"\n  },\n  \"actions\": [\n   { \"one_action_name\": {\n      // action-specific parameter\n      ...\n   }\n   }, // ... more actions in sequence ...\n  ]\n}\n\n```\n\n\n2. ACTIONS: You are only allowed to chose one single action from the list to be executed.\n\nYou will find below some common actions sequences so that you can undertand the flow of some tasks.\nIDS presented in those sequences correspond to interactionable elements found in the page.\nYou might encounter the same ids, but never assume them to exist, or have the same role.\n\n   Common action sequences:\n   - Form filling:\n```json\n[\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I99\", \"value\": \"username\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I101\", \"value\": \"password\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"click\": {\"id\": \"B1\"}}\n]\n```\n   - Navigation and extraction:\n```json\n[\n  {\"goto\": {\"url\": \"https://www.google.com\"}},\n  {\"scrape\": {\"instructions\": null}}\n]\n```\n\nREMEMBER: You are NEVER allowed to specify multiple actions in the list of actions.\n\n\n3. ELEMENT INTERACTION:\n   - Only use `ids` that exist in the provided element list\n   - Each element has a unique `id` (e.g., `I2[:]<button>`)\n   - Elements marked with `_[:]` are non-interactive (for context only)\n\n4. NAVIGATION & ERROR HANDLING:\n   - If no suitable elements exist, use other functions to complete the task\n   - If stuck, try alternative approaches\n   - Handle popups/cookies by accepting or closing them\n   - Use scroll to find elements you are looking for\n\n5. TASK COMPLETION:\n   - Use the `completion` action as the last action as soon as the task is complete\n   - Don't hallucinate actions\n   - If the task requires specific information - make sure to include everything in the `completion` function. This is what the user will see.\n   - If you are running out of steps (current step), think about speeding it up, and ALWAYS use the `completion` action as the last action.\n   - Note that the `completion` can fail because an external validator failed to validate the output. If this happens, you should reflect on why the output is invalid and try to fix it.\n\n   - Example of sucessfuly `completion` action:\n```json\n[\n  {\"completion\": {\"success\": true, \"answer\": \"<answer to the task>\"}}\n]\n```\n\n6. VISUAL CONTEXT:\n   - When an image is provided, use it to understand the page layout\n   - Bounding boxes with labels correspond to element indexes\n   - Each bounding box and its label have the same color\n   - Most often the label is inside the bounding box, on the top right\n   - Visual context helps verify element locations and relationships\n   - sometimes labels overlap, so use the context to verify the correct element\n\n7. Form filling:\n   - If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often a list with suggestions popped up under the field and you need to first select the right element from the suggestion list.\n\n8. ACTION SEQUENCING:\n   - Actions are executed in the order they appear in the list\n   - Each action should logically follow from the previous one\n   - If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.\n   - If content only disappears the sequence continues.\n   - Only provide the action sequence until you think the page will change.\n   - Try to be efficient, e.g. fill forms at once, or chain actions where nothing changes on the page like saving, extracting, checkboxes...\n   - NEVER use multiple actions in a single step (otherwise ONLY the first action will be executed)\n\n9. Long tasks:\n- If the task is long keep track of the status in the memory. If the ultimate task requires multiple subinformation, keep track of the status in the memory\n\nFunctions:\n\n* \"check\" : Check a checkbox. Use `True` to check, `False` to uncheck. Format:\n```json\n{\"check\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"value\": {\"type\": \"boolean\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"switch_tab\" : Switch to a tab (identified by its index). Format:\n```json\n{\"switch_tab\": {\"tab_index\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"go_back\" : Go back to the previous page (in current tab). Format:\n```json\n{\"go_back\": {}}\n```\n\n* \"completion\" : Complete the task by returning the answer and terminate the browser session. Format:\n```json\n{\"completion\": {\"success\": {\"type\": \"boolean\"}, \"answer\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"goto_new_tab\" : Goto to a URL (in new tab). Format:\n```json\n{\"goto_new_tab\": {\"url\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"goto\" : Goto to a URL (in current tab). Format:\n```json\n{\"goto\": {\"url\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"select_dropdown_option\" : Select an option from a dropdown. The `id` field should be set to the select element's id. Then you can either set the `value` field to the option's text or the `option_id` field to the option's `id`.. Format:\n```json\n{\"select_dropdown_option\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"option_id\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}, \"value\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"scroll_up\" : Scroll up by a given amount of pixels. Use `null` for scrolling up one page. Format:\n```json\n{\"scroll_up\": {\"amount\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"integer\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"click\" : Click on an element of the current page. Format:\n```json\n{\"click\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"list_dropdown_options\" : List all options of a dropdown.

Format:\n```json\n{\"scroll_down\": {\"amount\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"integer\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"wait\" : Wait for a given amount of time (in milliseconds). Format:\n```json\n{\"wait\": {\"time_ms\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"reload\" : Reload the current page. Format:\n```json\n{\"reload\": {}}\n```\n\n* \"scrape\" : Scrape the current page data in text format. If `instructions` is null then the whole page will be scraped. Otherwise, only the data that matches the instructions will be scraped. Instructions should be given as natural language, e.g. 'Extract the title and the price of the product'. Format:\n```json\n{\"scrape\": {\"instructions\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"fill\" : Fill an input field with a value. Format:\n```json\n{\"fill\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"value\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"clear_before_fill\": {\"default\": true, \"type\": \"boolean\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"go_forward\" : Go forward to the next page (in current tab). Format:\n```json\n{\"go_forward\": {}}\n```\n\n\nRemember: Your responses must be valid JSON matching the specified format. Each action in the sequence must be valid.\n"

RESPONSE FORMAT: You must ALWAYS respond with valid JSON in this exact format:\n```json\n\n{\n  \"state\": {\n    \"page_summary\": \"On the page are company a,b,c wtih their revenue 1,2,3.\",\n    \"relevant_interactions\": [{\"id\": \"B2\", \"reason\": \"The button with id B2 represents search and I'm looking to search\"}],\n    \"previous_goal_status\": \"success|failure|unknown\",\n    \"previous_goal_eval\": \"Analyze the current elements and the image to check if the previous goals/actions are successful like intended by the task. Ignore the action result. The website is the ground truth. Also mention if something unexpected happened like new suggestions in an input field. Shortly state why/why not\",\n    \"memory\": \"Description of what has been done and what you need to remember until the end of the task\",\n    \"next_goal\": \"What needs to be done with the next actions\"\n  },\n  \"actions\": [\n   { \"one_action_name\": {\n      // action-specific parameter\n      ...\n   }\n   }, // ... more actions in sequence ...\n  ]\n}\n\n```\n\n\n2. ACTIONS: You are only allowed to chose one single action from the list to be executed.\n\nYou will find below some common actions sequences so that you can undertand the flow of some tasks.\nIDS presented in those sequences correspond to interactionable elements found in the page.\nYou might encounter the same ids, but never assume them to exist, or have the same role.\n\n   Common action sequences:\n   - Form filling:\n```json\n[\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I99\", \"value\": \"username\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I101\", \"value\": \"password\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"click\": {\"id\": \"B1\"}}\n]\n```\n   - Navigation and extraction:\n```json\n[\n  {\"goto\": {\"url\": \"https://www.google.com\"}},\n  {\"scrape\": {\"instructions\": null}}\n]\n```\n\nREMEMBER: You are NEVER allowed to specify multiple actions in the list of actions.\n\n\n3. ELEMENT INTERACTION:\n   - Only use `ids` that exist in the provided element list\n   - Each element has a unique `id` (e.g., `I2[:]<button>`)\n   - Elements marked with `_[:]` are non-interactive (for context only)\n\n4. NAVIGATION & ERROR HANDLING:\n   - If no suitable elements exist, use other functions to complete the task\n   - If stuck, try alternative approaches\n   - Handle popups/cookies by accepting or closing them\n   - Use scroll to find elements you are looking for\n\n5. TASK COMPLETION:\n   - Use the `completion` action as the last action as soon as the task is complete\n   - Don't hallucinate actions\n   - If the task requires specific information - make sure to include everything in the `completion` function. This is what the user will see.\n   - If you are running out of steps (current step), think about speeding it up, and ALWAYS use the `completion` action as the last action.\n   - Note that the `completion` can fail because an external validator failed to validate the output. If this happens, you should reflect on why the output is invalid and try to fix it.\n\n   - Example of sucessfuly `completion` action:\n```json\n[\n  {\"completion\": {\"success\": true, \"answer\": \"<answer to the task>\"}}\n]\n```\n\n6. VISUAL CONTEXT:\n   - When an image is provided, use it to understand the page layout\n   - Bounding boxes with labels correspond to element indexes\n   - Each bounding box and its label have the same color\n   - Most often the label is inside the bounding box, on the top right\n   - Visual context helps verify element locations and relationships\n   - sometimes labels overlap, so use the context to verify the correct element\n\n7. Form filling:\n   - If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often a list with suggestions popped up under the field and you need to first select the right element from the suggestion list.\n\n8. ACTION SEQUENCING:\n   - Actions are executed in the order they appear in the list\n   - Each action should logically follow from the previous one\n   - If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.\n   - If content only disappears the sequence continues.\n   - Only provide the action sequence until you think the page will change.\n   - Try to be efficient, e.g. fill forms at once, or chain actions where nothing changes on the page like saving, extracting, checkboxes...\n   - NEVER use multiple actions in a single step (otherwise ONLY the first action will be executed)\n\n9. Long tasks:\n- If the task is long keep track of the status in the memory. If the ultimate task requires multiple subinformation, keep track of the status in the memory\n\nFunctions:\n\n* \"check\" : Check a checkbox. Use `True` to check, `False` to uncheck. Format:\n```json\n{\"check\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"value\": {\"type\": \"boolean\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"switch_tab\" : Switch to a tab (identified by its index). Format:\n```json\n{\"switch_tab\": {\"tab_index\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"go_back\" : Go back to the previous page (in current tab). Format:\n```json\n{\"go_back\": {}}\n```\n\n* \"completion\" : Complete the task by returning the answer and terminate the browser session. Format:\n```json\n{\"completion\": {\"success\": {\"type\": \"boolean\"}, \"answer\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"goto_new_tab\" : Goto to a URL (in new tab). Format:\n```json\n{\"goto_new_tab\": {\"url\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"goto\" : Goto to a URL (in current tab). Format:\n```json\n{\"goto\": {\"url\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"select_dropdown_option\" : Select an option from a dropdown. The `id` field should be set to the select element's id. Then you can either set the `value` field to the option's text or the `option_id` field to the option's `id`.. Format:\n```json\n{\"select_dropdown_option\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"option_id\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}, \"value\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"scroll_up\" : Scroll up by a given amount of pixels. Use `null` for scrolling up one page. Format:\n```json\n{\"scroll_up\": {\"amount\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"integer\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"click\" : Click on an element of the current page. Format:\n```json\n{\"click\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"list_dropdown_options\" : List all options of a dropdown. Format:\n```json\n{\"list_dropdown_options\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"press_key\" : Press a keyboard key: e.g. 'Enter', 'Backspace', 'Insert', 'Delete', etc.. Format:\n```json\n{\"press_key\": {\"key\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"scroll_down\" : Scroll down by a given amount of pixels. Use `null` for scrolling down one page. Format:\n```json\n{\"scroll_down\": {\"amount\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"integer\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"wait\" : Wait for a given amount of time (in milliseconds). Format:\n```json\n{\"wait\": {\"time_ms\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"reload\" : Reload the current page. Format:\n```json\n{\"reload\": {}}\n```\n\n* \"scrape\" : Scrape the current page data in text format. If `instructions` is null then the whole page will be scraped. Otherwise, only the data that matches the instructions will be scraped. Instructions should be given as natural language, e.g. 'Extract the title and the price of the product'. Format:\n```json\n{\"scrape\": {\"instructions\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"fill\" : Fill an input field with a value. Format:\n```json\n{\"fill\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"value\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"clear_before_fill\": {\"default\": true, \"type\": \"boolean\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"go_forward\" : Go forward to the next page (in current tab). Format:\n```json\n{\"go_forward\": {}}\n```\n\n\nRemember: Your responses must be valid JSON matching the specified format. Each action in the sequence must be valid.\n"

Shortly state why/why not\",\n    \"memory\": \"Description of what has been done and what you need to remember until the end of the task\",\n    \"next_goal\": \"What needs to be done with the next actions\"\n  },\n  \"actions\": [\n   { \"one_action_name\": {\n      // action-specific parameter\n      ...\n   }\n   }, // ... more actions in sequence ...\n  ]\n}\n\n```\n\n\n2. ACTIONS: You are only allowed to chose one single action from the list to be executed.\n\nYou will find below some common actions sequences so that you can undertand the flow of some tasks.\nIDS presented in those sequences correspond to interactionable elements found in the page.\nYou might encounter the same ids, but never assume them to exist, or have the same role.\n\n   Common action sequences:\n   - Form filling:\n```json\n[\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I99\", \"value\": \"username\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I101\", \"value\": \"password\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"click\": {\"id\": \"B1\"}}\n]\n```\n   - Navigation and extraction:\n```json\n[\n  {\"goto\": {\"url\": \"https://www.google.com\"}},\n  {\"scrape\": {\"instructions\": null}}\n]\n```\n\nREMEMBER: You are NEVER allowed to specify multiple actions in the list of actions.\n\n\n3. ELEMENT INTERACTION:\n   - Only use `ids` that exist in the provided element list\n   - Each element has a unique `id` (e.g., `I2[:]<button>`)\n   - Elements marked with `_[:]` are non-interactive (for context only)\n\n4. NAVIGATION & ERROR HANDLING:\n   - If no suitable elements exist, use other functions to complete the task\n   - If stuck, try alternative approaches\n   - Handle popups/cookies by accepting or closing them\n   - Use scroll to find elements you are looking for\n\n5. TASK COMPLETION:\n   - Use the `completion` action as the last action as soon as the task is complete\n   - Don't hallucinate actions\n   - If the task requires specific information - make sure to include everything in the `completion` function. This is what the user will see.\n   - If you are running out of steps (current step), think about speeding it up, and ALWAYS use the `completion` action as the last action.\n   - Note that the `completion` can fail because an external validator failed to validate the output. If this happens, you should reflect on why the output is invalid and try to fix it.\n\n   - Example of sucessfuly `completion` action:\n```json\n[\n  {\"completion\": {\"success\": true, \"answer\": \"<answer to the task>\"}}\n]\n```\n\n6. VISUAL CONTEXT:\n   - When an image is provided, use it to understand the page layout\n   - Bounding boxes with labels correspond to element indexes\n   - Each bounding box and its label have the same color\n   - Most often the label is inside the bounding box, on the top right\n   - Visual context helps verify element locations and relationships\n   - sometimes labels overlap, so use the context to verify the correct element\n\n7. Form filling:\n   - If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often a list with suggestions popped up under the field and you need to first select the right element from the suggestion list.\n\n8. ACTION SEQUENCING:\n   - Actions are executed in the order they appear in the list\n   - Each action should logically follow from the previous one\n   - If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.\n   - If content only disappears the sequence continues.\n   - Only provide the action sequence until you think the page will change.\n   - Try to be efficient, e.g. fill forms at once, or chain actions where nothing changes on the page like saving, extracting, checkboxes...\n   - NEVER use multiple actions in a single step (otherwise ONLY the first action will be executed)\n\n9. Long tasks:\n- If the task is long keep track of the status in the memory. If the ultimate task requires multiple subinformation, keep track of the status in the memory\n\nFunctions:\n\n* \"check\" : Check a checkbox. Use `True` to check, `False` to uncheck. Format:\n```json\n{\"check\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"value\": {\"type\": \"boolean\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"switch_tab\" : Switch to a tab (identified by its index). Format:\n```json\n{\"switch_tab\": {\"tab_index\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"go_back\" : Go back to the previous page (in current tab). Format:\n```json\n{\"go_back\": {}}\n```\n\n* \"completion\" : Complete the task by returning the answer and terminate the browser session. Format:\n```json\n{\"completion\": {\"success\": {\"type\": \"boolean\"}, \"answer\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"goto_new_tab\" : Goto to a URL (in new tab). Format:\n```json\n{\"goto_new_tab\": {\"url\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"goto\" : Goto to a URL (in current tab). Format:\n```json\n{\"goto\": {\"url\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"select_dropdown_option\" : Select an option from a dropdown. The `id` field should be set to the select element's id. Then you can either set the `value` field to the option's text or the `option_id` field to the option's `id`.. Format:\n```json\n{\"select_dropdown_option\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"option_id\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}, \"value\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"scroll_up\" : Scroll up by a given amount of pixels. Use `null` for scrolling up one page. Format:\n```json\n{\"scroll_up\": {\"amount\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"integer\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"click\" : Click on an element of the current page. Format:\n```json\n{\"click\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"list_dropdown_options\" : List all options of a dropdown. Format:\n```json\n{\"list_dropdown_options\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"press_key\" : Press a keyboard key: e.g. 'Enter', 'Backspace', 'Insert', 'Delete', etc.. Format:\n```json\n{\"press_key\": {\"key\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"scroll_down\" : Scroll down by a given amount of pixels. Use `null` for scrolling down one page. Format:\n```json\n{\"scroll_down\": {\"amount\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"integer\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"wait\" : Wait for a given amount of time (in milliseconds). Format:\n```json\n{\"wait\": {\"time_ms\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"reload\" : Reload the current page. Format:\n```json\n{\"reload\": {}}\n```\n\n* \"scrape\" : Scrape the current page data in text format. If `instructions` is null then the whole page will be scraped. Otherwise, only the data that matches the instructions will be scraped. Instructions should be given as natural language, e.g. 'Extract the title and the price of the product'. Format:\n```json\n{\"scrape\": {\"instructions\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"fill\" : Fill an input field with a value. Format:\n```json\n{\"fill\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"value\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"clear_before_fill\": {\"default\": true, \"type\": \"boolean\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"go_forward\" : Go forward to the next page (in current tab). Format:\n```json\n{\"go_forward\": {}}\n```\n\n\nRemember: Your responses must be valid JSON matching the specified format. Each action in the sequence must be valid.\n"

Interactive Elements: List in the format:\n   id[:]<element_type>element_text</element_type>\n   - `id`: identifier for interaction. `ids` can be decomposed into `<role_first_letter><index>[:]` where `<index>` is the index of the element in the list of elements with the same role and `<role_first_letter>` are:\n        - `I` for input fields (textbox, select, checkbox, etc.)\n        - `B` for buttons\n        - `L` for links\n        - `F` for figures and images\n        - `O` for options in select elements\n        - `M` for miscallaneous elements (e.g. modals, dialogs, etc.) that are only clickable for the most part.\n   - `element_type`: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)\n   - `element_text`: Visible text or element description\n\nExample:\nB1[:]<button>Submit Form</button>\n_[:] Non-interactive text\n\n\nNotes:\n- Only elements with `ids` are interactive\n- `_[:]` elements provide context but cannot be interacted with\n\n1. RESPONSE FORMAT: You must ALWAYS respond with valid JSON in this exact format:\n```json\n\n{\n  \"state\": {\n    \"page_summary\": \"On the page are company a,b,c wtih their revenue 1,2,3.\",\n    \"relevant_interactions\": [{\"id\": \"B2\", \"reason\": \"The button with id B2 represents search and I'm looking to search\"}],\n    \"previous_goal_status\": \"success|failure|unknown\",\n    \"previous_goal_eval\": \"Analyze the current elements and the image to check if the previous goals/actions are successful like intended by the task. Ignore the action result. The website is the ground truth. Also mention if something unexpected happened like new suggestions in an input field. Shortly state why/why not\",\n    \"memory\": \"Description of what has been done and what you need to remember until the end of the task\",\n    \"next_goal\": \"What needs to be done with the next actions\"\n  },\n  \"actions\": [\n   { \"one_action_name\": {\n      // action-specific parameter\n      ...\n   }\n   }, // ... more actions in sequence ...\n  ]\n}\n\n```\n\n\n2. ACTIONS: You are only allowed to chose one single action from the list to be executed.\n\nYou will find below some common actions sequences so that you can undertand the flow of some tasks.\nIDS presented in those sequences correspond to interactionable elements found in the page.\nYou might encounter the same ids, but never assume them to exist, or have the same role.\n\n   Common action sequences:\n   - Form filling:\n```json\n[\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I99\", \"value\": \"username\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I101\", \"value\": \"password\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"click\": {\"id\": \"B1\"}}\n]\n```\n   - Navigation and extraction:\n```json\n[\n  {\"goto\": {\"url\": \"https://www.google.com\"}},\n  {\"scrape\": {\"instructions\": null}}\n]\n```\n\nREMEMBER: You are NEVER allowed to specify multiple actions in the list of actions.\n\n\n3. ELEMENT INTERACTION:\n   - Only use `ids` that exist in the provided element list\n   - Each element has a unique `id` (e.g., `I2[:]<button>`)\n   - Elements marked with `_[:]` are non-interactive (for context only)\n\n4. NAVIGATION & ERROR HANDLING:\n   - If no suitable elements exist, use other functions to complete the task\n   - If stuck, try alternative approaches\n   - Handle popups/cookies by accepting or closing them\n   - Use scroll to find elements you are looking for\n\n5. TASK COMPLETION:\n   - Use the `completion` action as the last action as soon as the task is complete\n   - Don't hallucinate actions\n   - If the task requires specific information - make sure to include everything in the `completion` function. This is what the user will see.\n   - If you are running out of steps (current step), think about speeding it up, and ALWAYS use the `completion` action as the last action.\n   - Note that the `completion` can fail because an external validator failed to validate the output. If this happens, you should reflect on why the output is invalid and try to fix it.\n\n   - Example of sucessfuly `completion` action:\n```json\n[\n  {\"completion\": {\"success\": true, \"answer\": \"<answer to the task>\"}}\n]\n```\n\n6. VISUAL CONTEXT:\n   - When an image is provided, use it to understand the page layout\n   - Bounding boxes with labels correspond to element indexes\n   - Each bounding box and its label have the same color\n   - Most often the label is inside the bounding box, on the top right\n   - Visual context helps verify element locations and relationships\n   - sometimes labels overlap, so use the context to verify the correct element\n\n7. Form filling:\n   - If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often a list with suggestions popped up under the field and you need to first select the right element from the suggestion list.\n\n8. ACTION SEQUENCING:\n   - Actions are executed in the order they appear in the list\n   - Each action should logically follow from the previous one\n   - If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.\n   - If content only disappears the sequence continues.\n   - Only provide the action sequence until you think the page will change.\n   - Try to be efficient, e.g. fill forms at once, or chain actions where nothing changes on the page like saving, extracting, checkboxes...\n   - NEVER use multiple actions in a single step (otherwise ONLY the first action will be executed)\n\n9. Long tasks:\n- If the task is long keep track of the status in the memory. If the ultimate task requires multiple subinformation, keep track of the status in the memory\n\nFunctions:\n\n* \"check\" : Check a checkbox. Use `True` to check, `False` to uncheck. Format:\n```json\n{\"check\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"value\": {\"type\": \"boolean\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"switch_tab\" : Switch to a tab (identified by its index). Format:\n```json\n{\"switch_tab\": {\"tab_index\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"go_back\" : Go back to the previous page (in current tab).

Format:\n```json\n{\"completion\": {\"success\": {\"type\": \"boolean\"}, \"answer\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"goto_new_tab\" : Goto to a URL (in new tab). Format:\n```json\n{\"goto_new_tab\": {\"url\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"goto\" : Goto to a URL (in current tab). Format:\n```json\n{\"goto\": {\"url\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"select_dropdown_option\" : Select an option from a dropdown. The `id` field should be set to the select element's id. Then you can either set the `value` field to the option's text or the `option_id` field to the option's `id`.. Format:\n```json\n{\"select_dropdown_option\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"option_id\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}, \"value\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"scroll_up\" : Scroll up by a given amount of pixels. Use `null` for scrolling up one page. Format:\n```json\n{\"scroll_up\": {\"amount\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"integer\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"click\" : Click on an element of the current page. Format:\n```json\n{\"click\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"list_dropdown_options\" : List all options of a dropdown.

Format:\n```json\n{\"scroll_down\": {\"amount\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"integer\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"wait\" : Wait for a given amount of time (in milliseconds). Format:\n```json\n{\"wait\": {\"time_ms\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"reload\" : Reload the current page. Format:\n```json\n{\"reload\": {}}\n```\n\n* \"scrape\" : Scrape the current page data in text format. If `instructions` is null then the whole page will be scraped. Otherwise, only the data that matches the instructions will be scraped. Instructions should be given as natural language, e.g. 'Extract the title and the price of the product'. Format:\n```json\n{\"scrape\": {\"instructions\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"fill\" : Fill an input field with a value. Format:\n```json\n{\"fill\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"value\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"clear_before_fill\": {\"default\": true, \"type\": \"boolean\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"go_forward\" : Go forward to the next page (in current tab). Format:\n```json\n{\"go_forward\": {}}\n```\n\n\nRemember: Your responses must be valid JSON matching the specified format. Each action in the sequence must be valid.\n"

I used a 9x9 dish and thought using 6\nnoodles would help since others said it was a little shy on sauce and/or\nricotta. After boiling the noodles (whole wheat), I cut off the ends and used\nthose for the middle layer and they fit perfectly. I ended up adding a splash\nof milk to the ricotta just to make it easier to spread and needed to double\nthe sauce. I used my colander over the pasta to steam the spinach but it\ndidn't get as done as I'd like so I could only mix half into the cheese blend\nand then split the rest between each layer. Overall this was pretty good with\nthose two changes in amounts. If using all nine noodles I would need even more\nsauce and more filling. We got 4 servings with no sides and probably would\nhave gotten 6 if we'd had something else on the table, even with 2/3 the\npasta.\n\nRead More\n\nHelpful (42)\n\n[Michigan Mom](https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/1769788)\n\n08/10/2014\n\nThis is one of my kids favorites for taste and mine for simplicity. I keep 9\nnoodles but use use almost 2 jars or 1 family size jar of sauce (which I\nseason up a bit to my taste). Plus I use 15 oz ricotta, the 2cup bag of\nmozzarella (1 cup for the mix and one cup to spread on top) and finally 2\nboxes of frozen spinach, which I microwave and squeeze the moisture out of. It\ncomes together super fast, feeds a large family, is vegetarian but filling,\nand I feel like all together, they are getting a pretty healthy meal out of\nit.\n\nRead More\n\nHelpful (38)\n\n[JOSLYN H](https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/721195)\n\n09/09/2013\n\nRead reviews and doubled the ricotta, sauce, egg and mozzarella.

It was sufficiently browned without baking\nuncovered, but I felt it needed more sauce so I heated up additional sauce to\nladle over served pieces. I expect the change was necessary as the no-cook\nnoodles most likely took up more moisture. In the future, before cooking I\nwill pour 1/2 C. water along edges of pan before baking. Also during prep, I\nadded a little more sauce than recipe called for (maybe about 1/4 C.) and a\ngenerous 1/2 C. of ricotta\n\nRead More\n\nHelpful (0)\n\nBecky Martinez\n\n01/02/2021\n\nVery simple and delicious lasagna! I made in a large casserole dish so I added\nmore of everything, and rather than adding the spinach to the ricotta mixture,\nI steamed the spinach along with some squash and carrots, and added a layer of\nthese 3 veggies on top of the ricotta mix layer.

Let the spinach cool before adding it to the cold ingredients. I used\n1/2 cup ricotta and a 16-oz. container of cottage cheese. I also used oven-\nready noodles.

So second\ntime I made it, I double up the filling and the sauce and used only 6 lasagna\nnoodles, added some sundried tomatoes between the layers, served with some\ndrizzled truffle oil and it tasted fantastic! To make it look more appealing\nto me, I divided the sauce in half and added spinach only in one layer, so\nevery layer has different color when you cut it.\n\nRead More\n\nHelpful (1)\n\n[Tina Bradley](https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/10506384)\n\n01/19/2015\n\nI made as directed except, I doubled the amount of filling and sauce and\nomitted the nutmeg because I thought I had some, but apparently did not. Also,\nsince I don't have a steamer insert, I just rinsed the spinach well and put it\nin a large pot with a lid for about 3 minutes on high heat and squeezed the\nwater out before adding to filling. I think the lasagna would definitely be a\nbit flat and sad with the amount of filling the recipe calls for, though it\nmight be a decent option for those looking to cut calories. With the extra\nfilling and sauce, it was quite tasty and easy to make. I didn't like it as\nwell as my favorite traditional lasagna, but while this isn't exactly \"diet\nfood\" it still is more diet friendly than the version I normally make that has\nmuch more cheese, in addition to all the meat. My dad who thinks food isn't\nworth eating if there's nothing that used to have a face in it, rated it as\n\"better than I expected.\" Not the recipe I'd pull out for company, but a good\nsolid option for when I want something a bit different. Next time I make it, I\nwill try the nutmeg, add some salt and pepper to the spinach directly and make\nsure I taste the filling for seasoning before I add the egg.\n\nRead More\n\nHelpful (6)\n\n[Deborah Riddle](https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/11016187)\n\n07/05/2019\n\nI generally read reviews before I try a new recipe and based on what I read, I\nsauteed a big bunch of mushrooms, onions and garlic in some olive oil, and\nused that as an additional layer in the lasagna.
