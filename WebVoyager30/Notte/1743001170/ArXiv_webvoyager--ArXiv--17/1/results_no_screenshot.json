Available Tabs: List of open browser tabs\n3. Interactive Elements: List in the format:\n   id[:]<element_type>element_text</element_type>\n   - `id`: identifier for interaction. `ids` can be decomposed into `<role_first_letter><index>[:]` where `<index>` is the index of the element in the list of elements with the same role and `<role_first_letter>` are:\n        - `I` for input fields (textbox, select, checkbox, etc.)\n        - `B` for buttons\n        - `L` for links\n        - `F` for figures and images\n        - `O` for options in select elements\n        - `M` for miscallaneous elements (e.g. modals, dialogs, etc.) that are only clickable for the most part.\n   - `element_type`: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)\n   - `element_text`: Visible text or element description\n\nExample:\nB1[:]<button>Submit Form</button>\n_[:] Non-interactive text\n\n\nNotes:\n- Only elements with `ids` are interactive\n- `_[:]` elements provide context but cannot be interacted with\n\n1.

ACTIONS: You are only allowed to chose one single action from the list to be executed.\n\nYou will find below some common actions sequences so that you can undertand the flow of some tasks.\nIDS presented in those sequences correspond to interactionable elements found in the page.\nYou might encounter the same ids, but never assume them to exist, or have the same role.\n\n   Common action sequences:\n   - Form filling:\n```json\n[\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I99\", \"value\": \"username\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I101\", \"value\": \"password\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"click\": {\"id\": \"B1\"}}\n]\n```\n   - Navigation and extraction:\n```json\n[\n  {\"goto\": {\"url\": \"https://www.google.com\"}},\n  {\"scrape\": {\"instructions\": null}}\n]\n```\n\nREMEMBER: You are NEVER allowed to specify multiple actions in the list of actions.\n\n\n3. ELEMENT INTERACTION:\n   - Only use `ids` that exist in the provided element list\n   - Each element has a unique `id` (e.g., `I2[:]<button>`)\n   - Elements marked with `_[:]` are non-interactive (for context only)\n\n4. NAVIGATION & ERROR HANDLING:\n   - If no suitable elements exist, use other functions to complete the task\n   - If stuck, try alternative approaches\n   - Handle popups/cookies by accepting or closing them\n   - Use scroll to find elements you are looking for\n\n5. TASK COMPLETION:\n   - Use the `completion` action as the last action as soon as the task is complete\n   - Don't hallucinate actions\n   - If the task requires specific information - make sure to include everything in the `completion` function. This is what the user will see.\n   - If you are running out of steps (current step), think about speeding it up, and ALWAYS use the `completion` action as the last action.\n   - Note that the `completion` can fail because an external validator failed to validate the output. If this happens, you should reflect on why the output is invalid and try to fix it.\n\n   - Example of sucessfuly `completion` action:\n```json\n[\n  {\"completion\": {\"success\": true, \"answer\": \"<answer to the task>\"}}\n]\n```\n\n6. VISUAL CONTEXT:\n   - When an image is provided, use it to understand the page layout\n   - Bounding boxes with labels correspond to element indexes\n   - Each bounding box and its label have the same color\n   - Most often the label is inside the bounding box, on the top right\n   - Visual context helps verify element locations and relationships\n   - sometimes labels overlap, so use the context to verify the correct element\n\n7. Form filling:\n   - If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often a list with suggestions popped up under the field and you need to first select the right element from the suggestion list.\n\n8. ACTION SEQUENCING:\n   - Actions are executed in the order they appear in the list\n   - Each action should logically follow from the previous one\n   - If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.\n   - If content only disappears the sequence continues.\n   - Only provide the action sequence until you think the page will change.\n   - Try to be efficient, e.g. fill forms at once, or chain actions where nothing changes on the page like saving, extracting, checkboxes...\n   - NEVER use multiple actions in a single step (otherwise ONLY the first action will be executed)\n\n9. Long tasks:\n- If the task is long keep track of the status in the memory. If the ultimate task requires multiple subinformation, keep track of the status in the memory\n\nFunctions:\n\n* \"click\" : Click on an element of the current page.

Format:\n```json\n{\"scrape\": {\"instructions\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n\nRemember: Your responses must be valid JSON matching the specified format. Each action in the sequence must be valid.\n"

Analyze the provided webpage elements and structure\n2. Plan a sequence of actions to accomplish the given task\n3. Respond with valid JSON containing your action sequence and state assessment\n\nCurrent date and time: 2025-03-26 16:46:43\n\nINPUT STRUCTURE:\n1. Current URL: The webpage you're currently on\n2. Available Tabs: List of open browser tabs\n3. Interactive Elements: List in the format:\n   id[:]<element_type>element_text</element_type>\n   - `id`: identifier for interaction. `ids` can be decomposed into `<role_first_letter><index>[:]` where `<index>` is the index of the element in the list of elements with the same role and `<role_first_letter>` are:\n        - `I` for input fields (textbox, select, checkbox, etc.)\n        - `B` for buttons\n        - `L` for links\n        - `F` for figures and images\n        - `O` for options in select elements\n        - `M` for miscallaneous elements (e.g. modals, dialogs, etc.) that are only clickable for the most part.\n   - `element_type`: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)\n   - `element_text`: Visible text or element description\n\nExample:\nB1[:]<button>Submit Form</button>\n_[:] Non-interactive text\n\n\nNotes:\n- Only elements with `ids` are interactive\n- `_[:]` elements provide context but cannot be interacted with\n\n1. RESPONSE FORMAT: You must ALWAYS respond with valid JSON in this exact format:\n```json\n\n{\n  \"state\": {\n    \"page_summary\": \"On the page are company a,b,c wtih their revenue 1,2,3.\",\n    \"relevant_interactions\": [{\"id\": \"B2\", \"reason\": \"The button with id B2 represents search and I'm looking to search\"}],\n    \"previous_goal_status\": \"success|failure|unknown\",\n    \"previous_goal_eval\": \"Analyze the current elements and the image to check if the previous goals/actions are successful like intended by the task. Ignore the action result. The website is the ground truth. Also mention if something unexpected happened like new suggestions in an input field. Shortly state why/why not\",\n    \"memory\": \"Description of what has been done and what you need to remember until the end of the task\",\n    \"next_goal\": \"What needs to be done with the next actions\"\n  },\n  \"actions\": [\n   { \"one_action_name\": {\n      // action-specific parameter\n      ...\n   }\n   }, // ... more actions in sequence ...\n  ]\n}\n\n```\n\n\n2. ACTIONS: You are only allowed to chose one single action from the list to be executed.\n\nYou will find below some common actions sequences so that you can undertand the flow of some tasks.\nIDS presented in those sequences correspond to interactionable elements found in the page.\nYou might encounter the same ids, but never assume them to exist, or have the same role.\n\n   Common action sequences:\n   - Form filling:\n```json\n[\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I99\", \"value\": \"username\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I101\", \"value\": \"password\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"click\": {\"id\": \"B1\"}}\n]\n```\n   - Navigation and extraction:\n```json\n[\n  {\"goto\": {\"url\": \"https://www.google.com\"}},\n  {\"scrape\": {\"instructions\": null}}\n]\n```\n\nREMEMBER: You are NEVER allowed to specify multiple actions in the list of actions.\n\n\n3. ELEMENT INTERACTION:\n   - Only use `ids` that exist in the provided element list\n   - Each element has a unique `id` (e.g., `I2[:]<button>`)\n   - Elements marked with `_[:]` are non-interactive (for context only)\n\n4. NAVIGATION & ERROR HANDLING:\n   - If no suitable elements exist, use other functions to complete the task\n   - If stuck, try alternative approaches\n   - Handle popups/cookies by accepting or closing them\n   - Use scroll to find elements you are looking for\n\n5. TASK COMPLETION:\n   - Use the `completion` action as the last action as soon as the task is complete\n   - Don't hallucinate actions\n   - If the task requires specific information - make sure to include everything in the `completion` function. This is what the user will see.\n   - If you are running out of steps (current step), think about speeding it up, and ALWAYS use the `completion` action as the last action.\n   - Note that the `completion` can fail because an external validator failed to validate the output. If this happens, you should reflect on why the output is invalid and try to fix it.\n\n   - Example of sucessfuly `completion` action:\n```json\n[\n  {\"completion\": {\"success\": true, \"answer\": \"<answer to the task>\"}}\n]\n```\n\n6. VISUAL CONTEXT:\n   - When an image is provided, use it to understand the page layout\n   - Bounding boxes with labels correspond to element indexes\n   - Each bounding box and its label have the same color\n   - Most often the label is inside the bounding box, on the top right\n   - Visual context helps verify element locations and relationships\n   - sometimes labels overlap, so use the context to verify the correct element\n\n7. Form filling:\n   - If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often a list with suggestions popped up under the field and you need to first select the right element from the suggestion list.\n\n8. ACTION SEQUENCING:\n   - Actions are executed in the order they appear in the list\n   - Each action should logically follow from the previous one\n   - If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.\n   - If content only disappears the sequence continues.\n   - Only provide the action sequence until you think the page will change.\n   - Try to be efficient, e.g. fill forms at once, or chain actions where nothing changes on the page like saving, extracting, checkboxes...\n   - NEVER use multiple actions in a single step (otherwise ONLY the first action will be executed)\n\n9. Long tasks:\n- If the task is long keep track of the status in the memory. If the ultimate task requires multiple subinformation, keep track of the status in the memory\n\nFunctions:\n\n* \"click\" : Click on an element of the current page.

Analyze the provided webpage elements and structure\n2. Plan a sequence of actions to accomplish the given task\n3. Respond with valid JSON containing your action sequence and state assessment\n\nCurrent date and time: 2025-03-26 16:46:49\n\nINPUT STRUCTURE:\n1. Current URL: The webpage you're currently on\n2. Available Tabs: List of open browser tabs\n3. Interactive Elements: List in the format:\n   id[:]<element_type>element_text</element_type>\n   - `id`: identifier for interaction. `ids` can be decomposed into `<role_first_letter><index>[:]` where `<index>` is the index of the element in the list of elements with the same role and `<role_first_letter>` are:\n        - `I` for input fields (textbox, select, checkbox, etc.)\n        - `B` for buttons\n        - `L` for links\n        - `F` for figures and images\n        - `O` for options in select elements\n        - `M` for miscallaneous elements (e.g. modals, dialogs, etc.) that are only clickable for the most part.\n   - `element_type`: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)\n   - `element_text`: Visible text or element description\n\nExample:\nB1[:]<button>Submit Form</button>\n_[:] Non-interactive text\n\n\nNotes:\n- Only elements with `ids` are interactive\n- `_[:]` elements provide context but cannot be interacted with\n\n1. RESPONSE FORMAT: You must ALWAYS respond with valid JSON in this exact format:\n```json\n\n{\n  \"state\": {\n    \"page_summary\": \"On the page are company a,b,c wtih their revenue 1,2,3.\",\n    \"relevant_interactions\": [{\"id\": \"B2\", \"reason\": \"The button with id B2 represents search and I'm looking to search\"}],\n    \"previous_goal_status\": \"success|failure|unknown\",\n    \"previous_goal_eval\": \"Analyze the current elements and the image to check if the previous goals/actions are successful like intended by the task. Ignore the action result. The website is the ground truth. Also mention if something unexpected happened like new suggestions in an input field. Shortly state why/why not\",\n    \"memory\": \"Description of what has been done and what you need to remember until the end of the task\",\n    \"next_goal\": \"What needs to be done with the next actions\"\n  },\n  \"actions\": [\n   { \"one_action_name\": {\n      // action-specific parameter\n      ...\n   }\n   }, // ... more actions in sequence ...\n  ]\n}\n\n```\n\n\n2. ACTIONS: You are only allowed to chose one single action from the list to be executed.\n\nYou will find below some common actions sequences so that you can undertand the flow of some tasks.\nIDS presented in those sequences correspond to interactionable elements found in the page.\nYou might encounter the same ids, but never assume them to exist, or have the same role.\n\n   Common action sequences:\n   - Form filling:\n```json\n[\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I99\", \"value\": \"username\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I101\", \"value\": \"password\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"click\": {\"id\": \"B1\"}}\n]\n```\n   - Navigation and extraction:\n```json\n[\n  {\"goto\": {\"url\": \"https://www.google.com\"}},\n  {\"scrape\": {\"instructions\": null}}\n]\n```\n\nREMEMBER: You are NEVER allowed to specify multiple actions in the list of actions.\n\n\n3. ELEMENT INTERACTION:\n   - Only use `ids` that exist in the provided element list\n   - Each element has a unique `id` (e.g., `I2[:]<button>`)\n   - Elements marked with `_[:]` are non-interactive (for context only)\n\n4. NAVIGATION & ERROR HANDLING:\n   - If no suitable elements exist, use other functions to complete the task\n   - If stuck, try alternative approaches\n   - Handle popups/cookies by accepting or closing them\n   - Use scroll to find elements you are looking for\n\n5. TASK COMPLETION:\n   - Use the `completion` action as the last action as soon as the task is complete\n   - Don't hallucinate actions\n   - If the task requires specific information - make sure to include everything in the `completion` function. This is what the user will see.\n   - If you are running out of steps (current step), think about speeding it up, and ALWAYS use the `completion` action as the last action.\n   - Note that the `completion` can fail because an external validator failed to validate the output. If this happens, you should reflect on why the output is invalid and try to fix it.\n\n   - Example of sucessfuly `completion` action:\n```json\n[\n  {\"completion\": {\"success\": true, \"answer\": \"<answer to the task>\"}}\n]\n```\n\n6. VISUAL CONTEXT:\n   - When an image is provided, use it to understand the page layout\n   - Bounding boxes with labels correspond to element indexes\n   - Each bounding box and its label have the same color\n   - Most often the label is inside the bounding box, on the top right\n   - Visual context helps verify element locations and relationships\n   - sometimes labels overlap, so use the context to verify the correct element\n\n7. Form filling:\n   - If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often a list with suggestions popped up under the field and you need to first select the right element from the suggestion list.\n\n8. ACTION SEQUENCING:\n   - Actions are executed in the order they appear in the list\n   - Each action should logically follow from the previous one\n   - If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.\n   - If content only disappears the sequence continues.\n   - Only provide the action sequence until you think the page will change.\n   - Try to be efficient, e.g. fill forms at once, or chain actions where nothing changes on the page like saving, extracting, checkboxes...\n   - NEVER use multiple actions in a single step (otherwise ONLY the first action will be executed)\n\n9. Long tasks:\n- If the task is long keep track of the status in the memory. If the ultimate task requires multiple subinformation, keep track of the status in the memory\n\nFunctions:\n\n* \"click\" : Click on an element of the current page. Format:\n```json\n{\"click\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"list_dropdown_options\" : List all options of a dropdown. Format:\n```json\n{\"list_dropdown_options\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"go_forward\" : Go forward to the next page (in current tab).

Format:\n```json\n{\"switch_tab\": {\"tab_index\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"go_back\" : Go back to the previous page (in current tab). Format:\n```json\n{\"go_back\": {}}\n```\n\n* \"completion\" : Complete the task by returning the answer and terminate the browser session. Format:\n```json\n{\"completion\": {\"success\": {\"type\": \"boolean\"}, \"answer\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"goto_new_tab\" : Goto to a URL (in new tab). Format:\n```json\n{\"goto_new_tab\": {\"url\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"goto\" : Goto to a URL (in current tab). Format:\n```json\n{\"goto\": {\"url\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"fill\" : Fill an input field with a value. Format:\n```json\n{\"fill\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"value\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"clear_before_fill\": {\"default\": true, \"type\": \"boolean\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"scroll_up\" : Scroll up by a given amount of pixels. Use `null` for scrolling up one page. Format:\n```json\n{\"scroll_up\": {\"amount\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"integer\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"check\" : Check a checkbox. Use `True` to check, `False` to uncheck. Format:\n```json\n{\"check\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"value\": {\"type\": \"boolean\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"press_key\" : Press a keyboard key: e.g. 'Enter', 'Backspace', 'Insert', 'Delete', etc.. Format:\n```json\n{\"press_key\": {\"key\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"scroll_down\" : Scroll down by a given amount of pixels. Use `null` for scrolling down one page. Format:\n```json\n{\"scroll_down\": {\"amount\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"integer\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"wait\" : Wait for a given amount of time (in milliseconds). Format:\n```json\n{\"wait\": {\"time_ms\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"select_dropdown_option\" : Select an option from a dropdown. The `id` field should be set to the select element's id. Then you can either set the `value` field to the option's text or the `option_id` field to the option's `id`.. Format:\n```json\n{\"select_dropdown_option\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"option_id\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}, \"value\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"reload\" : Reload the current page. Format:\n```json\n{\"reload\": {}}\n```\n\n* \"scrape\" : Scrape the current page data in text format. If `instructions` is null then the whole page will be scraped. Otherwise, only the data that matches the instructions will be scraped. Instructions should be given as natural language, e.g. 'Extract the title and the price of the product'. Format:\n```json\n{\"scrape\": {\"instructions\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n\nRemember: Your responses must be valid JSON matching the specified format. Each action in the sequence must be valid.\n"

Available Tabs: List of open browser tabs\n3. Interactive Elements: List in the format:\n   id[:]<element_type>element_text</element_type>\n   - `id`: identifier for interaction. `ids` can be decomposed into `<role_first_letter><index>[:]` where `<index>` is the index of the element in the list of elements with the same role and `<role_first_letter>` are:\n        - `I` for input fields (textbox, select, checkbox, etc.)\n        - `B` for buttons\n        - `L` for links\n        - `F` for figures and images\n        - `O` for options in select elements\n        - `M` for miscallaneous elements (e.g. modals, dialogs, etc.) that are only clickable for the most part.\n   - `element_type`: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)\n   - `element_text`: Visible text or element description\n\nExample:\nB1[:]<button>Submit Form</button>\n_[:] Non-interactive text\n\n\nNotes:\n- Only elements with `ids` are interactive\n- `_[:]` elements provide context but cannot be interacted with\n\n1.

ACTIONS: You are only allowed to chose one single action from the list to be executed.\n\nYou will find below some common actions sequences so that you can undertand the flow of some tasks.\nIDS presented in those sequences correspond to interactionable elements found in the page.\nYou might encounter the same ids, but never assume them to exist, or have the same role.\n\n   Common action sequences:\n   - Form filling:\n```json\n[\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I99\", \"value\": \"username\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I101\", \"value\": \"password\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"click\": {\"id\": \"B1\"}}\n]\n```\n   - Navigation and extraction:\n```json\n[\n  {\"goto\": {\"url\": \"https://www.google.com\"}},\n  {\"scrape\": {\"instructions\": null}}\n]\n```\n\nREMEMBER: You are NEVER allowed to specify multiple actions in the list of actions.\n\n\n3. ELEMENT INTERACTION:\n   - Only use `ids` that exist in the provided element list\n   - Each element has a unique `id` (e.g., `I2[:]<button>`)\n   - Elements marked with `_[:]` are non-interactive (for context only)\n\n4. NAVIGATION & ERROR HANDLING:\n   - If no suitable elements exist, use other functions to complete the task\n   - If stuck, try alternative approaches\n   - Handle popups/cookies by accepting or closing them\n   - Use scroll to find elements you are looking for\n\n5. TASK COMPLETION:\n   - Use the `completion` action as the last action as soon as the task is complete\n   - Don't hallucinate actions\n   - If the task requires specific information - make sure to include everything in the `completion` function. This is what the user will see.\n   - If you are running out of steps (current step), think about speeding it up, and ALWAYS use the `completion` action as the last action.\n   - Note that the `completion` can fail because an external validator failed to validate the output. If this happens, you should reflect on why the output is invalid and try to fix it.\n\n   - Example of sucessfuly `completion` action:\n```json\n[\n  {\"completion\": {\"success\": true, \"answer\": \"<answer to the task>\"}}\n]\n```\n\n6. VISUAL CONTEXT:\n   - When an image is provided, use it to understand the page layout\n   - Bounding boxes with labels correspond to element indexes\n   - Each bounding box and its label have the same color\n   - Most often the label is inside the bounding box, on the top right\n   - Visual context helps verify element locations and relationships\n   - sometimes labels overlap, so use the context to verify the correct element\n\n7. Form filling:\n   - If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often a list with suggestions popped up under the field and you need to first select the right element from the suggestion list.\n\n8. ACTION SEQUENCING:\n   - Actions are executed in the order they appear in the list\n   - Each action should logically follow from the previous one\n   - If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.\n   - If content only disappears the sequence continues.\n   - Only provide the action sequence until you think the page will change.\n   - Try to be efficient, e.g. fill forms at once, or chain actions where nothing changes on the page like saving, extracting, checkboxes...\n   - NEVER use multiple actions in a single step (otherwise ONLY the first action will be executed)\n\n9. Long tasks:\n- If the task is long keep track of the status in the memory. If the ultimate task requires multiple subinformation, keep track of the status in the memory\n\nFunctions:\n\n* \"click\" : Click on an element of the current page. Format:\n```json\n{\"click\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"list_dropdown_options\" : List all options of a dropdown.

Format:\n```json\n{\"goto_new_tab\": {\"url\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"goto\" : Goto to a URL (in current tab). Format:\n```json\n{\"goto\": {\"url\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"fill\" : Fill an input field with a value. Format:\n```json\n{\"fill\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"value\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"clear_before_fill\": {\"default\": true, \"type\": \"boolean\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"scroll_up\" : Scroll up by a given amount of pixels. Use `null` for scrolling up one page. Format:\n```json\n{\"scroll_up\": {\"amount\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"integer\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"check\" : Check a checkbox. Use `True` to check, `False` to uncheck. Format:\n```json\n{\"check\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"value\": {\"type\": \"boolean\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"press_key\" : Press a keyboard key: e.g. 'Enter', 'Backspace', 'Insert', 'Delete', etc.. Format:\n```json\n{\"press_key\": {\"key\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"scroll_down\" : Scroll down by a given amount of pixels. Use `null` for scrolling down one page. Format:\n```json\n{\"scroll_down\": {\"amount\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"integer\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"wait\" : Wait for a given amount of time (in milliseconds). Format:\n```json\n{\"wait\": {\"time_ms\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"select_dropdown_option\" : Select an option from a dropdown. The `id` field should be set to the select element's id. Then you can either set the `value` field to the option's text or the `option_id` field to the option's `id`.. Format:\n```json\n{\"select_dropdown_option\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"option_id\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}, \"value\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"reload\" : Reload the current page. Format:\n```json\n{\"reload\": {}}\n```\n\n* \"scrape\" : Scrape the current page data in text format. If `instructions` is null then the whole page will be scraped. Otherwise, only the data that matches the instructions will be scraped. Instructions should be given as natural language, e.g. 'Extract the title and the price of the product'. Format:\n```json\n{\"scrape\": {\"instructions\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n\nRemember: Your responses must be valid JSON matching the specified format. Each action in the sequence must be valid.\n"

Ignore the action result. The website is the ground truth. Also mention if something unexpected happened like new suggestions in an input field. Shortly state why/why not\",\n    \"memory\": \"Description of what has been done and what you need to remember until the end of the task\",\n    \"next_goal\": \"What needs to be done with the next actions\"\n  },\n  \"actions\": [\n   { \"one_action_name\": {\n      // action-specific parameter\n      ...\n   }\n   }, // ... more actions in sequence ...\n  ]\n}\n\n```\n\n\n2. ACTIONS: You are only allowed to chose one single action from the list to be executed.\n\nYou will find below some common actions sequences so that you can undertand the flow of some tasks.\nIDS presented in those sequences correspond to interactionable elements found in the page.\nYou might encounter the same ids, but never assume them to exist, or have the same role.\n\n   Common action sequences:\n   - Form filling:\n```json\n[\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I99\", \"value\": \"username\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I101\", \"value\": \"password\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"click\": {\"id\": \"B1\"}}\n]\n```\n   - Navigation and extraction:\n```json\n[\n  {\"goto\": {\"url\": \"https://www.google.com\"}},\n  {\"scrape\": {\"instructions\": null}}\n]\n```\n\nREMEMBER: You are NEVER allowed to specify multiple actions in the list of actions.\n\n\n3. ELEMENT INTERACTION:\n   - Only use `ids` that exist in the provided element list\n   - Each element has a unique `id` (e.g., `I2[:]<button>`)\n   - Elements marked with `_[:]` are non-interactive (for context only)\n\n4. NAVIGATION & ERROR HANDLING:\n   - If no suitable elements exist, use other functions to complete the task\n   - If stuck, try alternative approaches\n   - Handle popups/cookies by accepting or closing them\n   - Use scroll to find elements you are looking for\n\n5. TASK COMPLETION:\n   - Use the `completion` action as the last action as soon as the task is complete\n   - Don't hallucinate actions\n   - If the task requires specific information - make sure to include everything in the `completion` function. This is what the user will see.\n   - If you are running out of steps (current step), think about speeding it up, and ALWAYS use the `completion` action as the last action.\n   - Note that the `completion` can fail because an external validator failed to validate the output. If this happens, you should reflect on why the output is invalid and try to fix it.\n\n   - Example of sucessfuly `completion` action:\n```json\n[\n  {\"completion\": {\"success\": true, \"answer\": \"<answer to the task>\"}}\n]\n```\n\n6. VISUAL CONTEXT:\n   - When an image is provided, use it to understand the page layout\n   - Bounding boxes with labels correspond to element indexes\n   - Each bounding box and its label have the same color\n   - Most often the label is inside the bounding box, on the top right\n   - Visual context helps verify element locations and relationships\n   - sometimes labels overlap, so use the context to verify the correct element\n\n7. Form filling:\n   - If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often a list with suggestions popped up under the field and you need to first select the right element from the suggestion list.\n\n8. ACTION SEQUENCING:\n   - Actions are executed in the order they appear in the list\n   - Each action should logically follow from the previous one\n   - If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.\n   - If content only disappears the sequence continues.\n   - Only provide the action sequence until you think the page will change.\n   - Try to be efficient, e.g. fill forms at once, or chain actions where nothing changes on the page like saving, extracting, checkboxes...\n   - NEVER use multiple actions in a single step (otherwise ONLY the first action will be executed)\n\n9. Long tasks:\n- If the task is long keep track of the status in the memory. If the ultimate task requires multiple subinformation, keep track of the status in the memory\n\nFunctions:\n\n* \"click\" : Click on an element of the current page.

This approach is crucial for optimizing resource allocation and ensuring data alignment with target tasks. To achieve this vision, we focus on predicting performance on Closed-book Question Answering (CBQA) tasks, which are closely tied to pre-training data and knowledge retention. We address three major challenges: 1) mastering the entire pre-training process, especially data construction; 2) evaluating a model's knowledge retention; and 3) predicting task-specific knowledge retention using only information available prior to training. To tackle these challenges, we pre-train three large language models (i.e., 1.6B, 7B, and 13B) using 560k dollars and 520k GPU hours. We analyze the pre-training data with knowledge triples and assess knowledge retention using established methods. Additionally, we introduce the SMI metric, an information-theoretic measure that quantifies the relationship between pre-training data, model size, and task-specific knowledge retention. Our experiments reveal a strong linear correlation (\nM1[:]<span tabindex=\"0\">R\n2\n>\n0.84</span>\n_[:]) between the SMI metric and the model's accuracy on CBQA tasks across models of varying sizes (i.e., 1.1B, 1.6B, 7B, and 13B).

Analyze the provided webpage elements and structure\n2. Plan a sequence of actions to accomplish the given task\n3. Respond with valid JSON containing your action sequence and state assessment\n\nCurrent date and time: 2025-03-26 16:47:08\n\nINPUT STRUCTURE:\n1. Current URL: The webpage you're currently on\n2. Available Tabs: List of open browser tabs\n3. Interactive Elements: List in the format:\n   id[:]<element_type>element_text</element_type>\n   - `id`: identifier for interaction. `ids` can be decomposed into `<role_first_letter><index>[:]` where `<index>` is the index of the element in the list of elements with the same role and `<role_first_letter>` are:\n        - `I` for input fields (textbox, select, checkbox, etc.)\n        - `B` for buttons\n        - `L` for links\n        - `F` for figures and images\n        - `O` for options in select elements\n        - `M` for miscallaneous elements (e.g. modals, dialogs, etc.) that are only clickable for the most part.\n   - `element_type`: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)\n   - `element_text`: Visible text or element description\n\nExample:\nB1[:]<button>Submit Form</button>\n_[:] Non-interactive text\n\n\nNotes:\n- Only elements with `ids` are interactive\n- `_[:]` elements provide context but cannot be interacted with\n\n1. RESPONSE FORMAT: You must ALWAYS respond with valid JSON in this exact format:\n```json\n\n{\n  \"state\": {\n    \"page_summary\": \"On the page are company a,b,c wtih their revenue 1,2,3.\",\n    \"relevant_interactions\": [{\"id\": \"B2\", \"reason\": \"The button with id B2 represents search and I'm looking to search\"}],\n    \"previous_goal_status\": \"success|failure|unknown\",\n    \"previous_goal_eval\": \"Analyze the current elements and the image to check if the previous goals/actions are successful like intended by the task. Ignore the action result. The website is the ground truth. Also mention if something unexpected happened like new suggestions in an input field. Shortly state why/why not\",\n    \"memory\": \"Description of what has been done and what you need to remember until the end of the task\",\n    \"next_goal\": \"What needs to be done with the next actions\"\n  },\n  \"actions\": [\n   { \"one_action_name\": {\n      // action-specific parameter\n      ...\n   }\n   }, // ... more actions in sequence ...\n  ]\n}\n\n```\n\n\n2. ACTIONS: You are only allowed to chose one single action from the list to be executed.\n\nYou will find below some common actions sequences so that you can undertand the flow of some tasks.\nIDS presented in those sequences correspond to interactionable elements found in the page.\nYou might encounter the same ids, but never assume them to exist, or have the same role.\n\n   Common action sequences:\n   - Form filling:\n```json\n[\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I99\", \"value\": \"username\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I101\", \"value\": \"password\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"click\": {\"id\": \"B1\"}}\n]\n```\n   - Navigation and extraction:\n```json\n[\n  {\"goto\": {\"url\": \"https://www.google.com\"}},\n  {\"scrape\": {\"instructions\": null}}\n]\n```\n\nREMEMBER: You are NEVER allowed to specify multiple actions in the list of actions.\n\n\n3. ELEMENT INTERACTION:\n   - Only use `ids` that exist in the provided element list\n   - Each element has a unique `id` (e.g., `I2[:]<button>`)\n   - Elements marked with `_[:]` are non-interactive (for context only)\n\n4. NAVIGATION & ERROR HANDLING:\n   - If no suitable elements exist, use other functions to complete the task\n   - If stuck, try alternative approaches\n   - Handle popups/cookies by accepting or closing them\n   - Use scroll to find elements you are looking for\n\n5. TASK COMPLETION:\n   - Use the `completion` action as the last action as soon as the task is complete\n   - Don't hallucinate actions\n   - If the task requires specific information - make sure to include everything in the `completion` function. This is what the user will see.\n   - If you are running out of steps (current step), think about speeding it up, and ALWAYS use the `completion` action as the last action.\n   - Note that the `completion` can fail because an external validator failed to validate the output. If this happens, you should reflect on why the output is invalid and try to fix it.\n\n   - Example of sucessfuly `completion` action:\n```json\n[\n  {\"completion\": {\"success\": true, \"answer\": \"<answer to the task>\"}}\n]\n```\n\n6. VISUAL CONTEXT:\n   - When an image is provided, use it to understand the page layout\n   - Bounding boxes with labels correspond to element indexes\n   - Each bounding box and its label have the same color\n   - Most often the label is inside the bounding box, on the top right\n   - Visual context helps verify element locations and relationships\n   - sometimes labels overlap, so use the context to verify the correct element\n\n7. Form filling:\n   - If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often a list with suggestions popped up under the field and you need to first select the right element from the suggestion list.\n\n8. ACTION SEQUENCING:\n   - Actions are executed in the order they appear in the list\n   - Each action should logically follow from the previous one\n   - If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.\n   - If content only disappears the sequence continues.\n   - Only provide the action sequence until you think the page will change.\n   - Try to be efficient, e.g. fill forms at once, or chain actions where nothing changes on the page like saving, extracting, checkboxes...\n   - NEVER use multiple actions in a single step (otherwise ONLY the first action will be executed)\n\n9. Long tasks:\n- If the task is long keep track of the status in the memory. If the ultimate task requires multiple subinformation, keep track of the status in the memory\n\nFunctions:\n\n* \"click\" : Click on an element of the current page.

Respond with valid JSON containing your action sequence and state assessment\n\nCurrent date and time: 2025-03-26 16:47:13\n\nINPUT STRUCTURE:\n1. Current URL: The webpage you're currently on\n2. Available Tabs: List of open browser tabs\n3. Interactive Elements: List in the format:\n   id[:]<element_type>element_text</element_type>\n   - `id`: identifier for interaction. `ids` can be decomposed into `<role_first_letter><index>[:]` where `<index>` is the index of the element in the list of elements with the same role and `<role_first_letter>` are:\n        - `I` for input fields (textbox, select, checkbox, etc.)\n        - `B` for buttons\n        - `L` for links\n        - `F` for figures and images\n        - `O` for options in select elements\n        - `M` for miscallaneous elements (e.g. modals, dialogs, etc.) that are only clickable for the most part.\n   - `element_type`: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)\n   - `element_text`: Visible text or element description\n\nExample:\nB1[:]<button>Submit Form</button>\n_[:] Non-interactive text\n\n\nNotes:\n- Only elements with `ids` are interactive\n- `_[:]` elements provide context but cannot be interacted with\n\n1. RESPONSE FORMAT: You must ALWAYS respond with valid JSON in this exact format:\n```json\n\n{\n  \"state\": {\n    \"page_summary\": \"On the page are company a,b,c wtih their revenue 1,2,3.\",\n    \"relevant_interactions\": [{\"id\": \"B2\", \"reason\": \"The button with id B2 represents search and I'm looking to search\"}],\n    \"previous_goal_status\": \"success|failure|unknown\",\n    \"previous_goal_eval\": \"Analyze the current elements and the image to check if the previous goals/actions are successful like intended by the task.

ACTIONS: You are only allowed to chose one single action from the list to be executed.\n\nYou will find below some common actions sequences so that you can undertand the flow of some tasks.\nIDS presented in those sequences correspond to interactionable elements found in the page.\nYou might encounter the same ids, but never assume them to exist, or have the same role.\n\n   Common action sequences:\n   - Form filling:\n```json\n[\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I99\", \"value\": \"username\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I101\", \"value\": \"password\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"click\": {\"id\": \"B1\"}}\n]\n```\n   - Navigation and extraction:\n```json\n[\n  {\"goto\": {\"url\": \"https://www.google.com\"}},\n  {\"scrape\": {\"instructions\": null}}\n]\n```\n\nREMEMBER: You are NEVER allowed to specify multiple actions in the list of actions.\n\n\n3. ELEMENT INTERACTION:\n   - Only use `ids` that exist in the provided element list\n   - Each element has a unique `id` (e.g., `I2[:]<button>`)\n   - Elements marked with `_[:]` are non-interactive (for context only)\n\n4. NAVIGATION & ERROR HANDLING:\n   - If no suitable elements exist, use other functions to complete the task\n   - If stuck, try alternative approaches\n   - Handle popups/cookies by accepting or closing them\n   - Use scroll to find elements you are looking for\n\n5. TASK COMPLETION:\n   - Use the `completion` action as the last action as soon as the task is complete\n   - Don't hallucinate actions\n   - If the task requires specific information - make sure to include everything in the `completion` function. This is what the user will see.\n   - If you are running out of steps (current step), think about speeding it up, and ALWAYS use the `completion` action as the last action.\n   - Note that the `completion` can fail because an external validator failed to validate the output. If this happens, you should reflect on why the output is invalid and try to fix it.\n\n   - Example of sucessfuly `completion` action:\n```json\n[\n  {\"completion\": {\"success\": true, \"answer\": \"<answer to the task>\"}}\n]\n```\n\n6. VISUAL CONTEXT:\n   - When an image is provided, use it to understand the page layout\n   - Bounding boxes with labels correspond to element indexes\n   - Each bounding box and its label have the same color\n   - Most often the label is inside the bounding box, on the top right\n   - Visual context helps verify element locations and relationships\n   - sometimes labels overlap, so use the context to verify the correct element\n\n7. Form filling:\n   - If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often a list with suggestions popped up under the field and you need to first select the right element from the suggestion list.\n\n8. ACTION SEQUENCING:\n   - Actions are executed in the order they appear in the list\n   - Each action should logically follow from the previous one\n   - If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.\n   - If content only disappears the sequence continues.\n   - Only provide the action sequence until you think the page will change.\n   - Try to be efficient, e.g. fill forms at once, or chain actions where nothing changes on the page like saving, extracting, checkboxes...\n   - NEVER use multiple actions in a single step (otherwise ONLY the first action will be executed)\n\n9. Long tasks:\n- If the task is long keep track of the status in the memory. If the ultimate task requires multiple subinformation, keep track of the status in the memory\n\nFunctions:\n\n* \"click\" : Click on an element of the current page. Format:\n```json\n{\"click\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"list_dropdown_options\" : List all options of a dropdown.

Format:\n```json\n{\"wait\": {\"time_ms\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"select_dropdown_option\" : Select an option from a dropdown. The `id` field should be set to the select element's id. Then you can either set the `value` field to the option's text or the `option_id` field to the option's `id`.. Format:\n```json\n{\"select_dropdown_option\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"option_id\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}, \"value\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"reload\" : Reload the current page. Format:\n```json\n{\"reload\": {}}\n```\n\n* \"scrape\" : Scrape the current page data in text format. If `instructions` is null then the whole page will be scraped. Otherwise, only the data that matches the instructions will be scraped. Instructions should be given as natural language, e.g. 'Extract the title and the price of the product'. Format:\n```json\n{\"scrape\": {\"instructions\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n\nRemember: Your responses must be valid JSON matching the specified format. Each action in the sequence must be valid.\n"

Analyze the provided webpage elements and structure\n2. Plan a sequence of actions to accomplish the given task\n3. Respond with valid JSON containing your action sequence and state assessment\n\nCurrent date and time: 2025-03-26 16:47:31\n\nINPUT STRUCTURE:\n1. Current URL: The webpage you're currently on\n2. Available Tabs: List of open browser tabs\n3. Interactive Elements: List in the format:\n   id[:]<element_type>element_text</element_type>\n   - `id`: identifier for interaction. `ids` can be decomposed into `<role_first_letter><index>[:]` where `<index>` is the index of the element in the list of elements with the same role and `<role_first_letter>` are:\n        - `I` for input fields (textbox, select, checkbox, etc.)\n        - `B` for buttons\n        - `L` for links\n        - `F` for figures and images\n        - `O` for options in select elements\n        - `M` for miscallaneous elements (e.g. modals, dialogs, etc.) that are only clickable for the most part.\n   - `element_type`: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)\n   - `element_text`: Visible text or element description\n\nExample:\nB1[:]<button>Submit Form</button>\n_[:] Non-interactive text\n\n\nNotes:\n- Only elements with `ids` are interactive\n- `_[:]` elements provide context but cannot be interacted with\n\n1. RESPONSE FORMAT: You must ALWAYS respond with valid JSON in this exact format:\n```json\n\n{\n  \"state\": {\n    \"page_summary\": \"On the page are company a,b,c wtih their revenue 1,2,3.\",\n    \"relevant_interactions\": [{\"id\": \"B2\", \"reason\": \"The button with id B2 represents search and I'm looking to search\"}],\n    \"previous_goal_status\": \"success|failure|unknown\",\n    \"previous_goal_eval\": \"Analyze the current elements and the image to check if the previous goals/actions are successful like intended by the task. Ignore the action result. The website is the ground truth. Also mention if something unexpected happened like new suggestions in an input field. Shortly state why/why not\",\n    \"memory\": \"Description of what has been done and what you need to remember until the end of the task\",\n    \"next_goal\": \"What needs to be done with the next actions\"\n  },\n  \"actions\": [\n   { \"one_action_name\": {\n      // action-specific parameter\n      ...\n   }\n   }, // ... more actions in sequence ...\n  ]\n}\n\n```\n\n\n2. ACTIONS: You are only allowed to chose one single action from the list to be executed.\n\nYou will find below some common actions sequences so that you can undertand the flow of some tasks.\nIDS presented in those sequences correspond to interactionable elements found in the page.\nYou might encounter the same ids, but never assume them to exist, or have the same role.\n\n   Common action sequences:\n   - Form filling:\n```json\n[\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I99\", \"value\": \"username\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I101\", \"value\": \"password\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"click\": {\"id\": \"B1\"}}\n]\n```\n   - Navigation and extraction:\n```json\n[\n  {\"goto\": {\"url\": \"https://www.google.com\"}},\n  {\"scrape\": {\"instructions\": null}}\n]\n```\n\nREMEMBER: You are NEVER allowed to specify multiple actions in the list of actions.\n\n\n3. ELEMENT INTERACTION:\n   - Only use `ids` that exist in the provided element list\n   - Each element has a unique `id` (e.g., `I2[:]<button>`)\n   - Elements marked with `_[:]` are non-interactive (for context only)\n\n4. NAVIGATION & ERROR HANDLING:\n   - If no suitable elements exist, use other functions to complete the task\n   - If stuck, try alternative approaches\n   - Handle popups/cookies by accepting or closing them\n   - Use scroll to find elements you are looking for\n\n5. TASK COMPLETION:\n   - Use the `completion` action as the last action as soon as the task is complete\n   - Don't hallucinate actions\n   - If the task requires specific information - make sure to include everything in the `completion` function. This is what the user will see.\n   - If you are running out of steps (current step), think about speeding it up, and ALWAYS use the `completion` action as the last action.\n   - Note that the `completion` can fail because an external validator failed to validate the output. If this happens, you should reflect on why the output is invalid and try to fix it.\n\n   - Example of sucessfuly `completion` action:\n```json\n[\n  {\"completion\": {\"success\": true, \"answer\": \"<answer to the task>\"}}\n]\n```\n\n6. VISUAL CONTEXT:\n   - When an image is provided, use it to understand the page layout\n   - Bounding boxes with labels correspond to element indexes\n   - Each bounding box and its label have the same color\n   - Most often the label is inside the bounding box, on the top right\n   - Visual context helps verify element locations and relationships\n   - sometimes labels overlap, so use the context to verify the correct element\n\n7. Form filling:\n   - If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often a list with suggestions popped up under the field and you need to first select the right element from the suggestion list.\n\n8. ACTION SEQUENCING:\n   - Actions are executed in the order they appear in the list\n   - Each action should logically follow from the previous one\n   - If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.\n   - If content only disappears the sequence continues.\n   - Only provide the action sequence until you think the page will change.\n   - Try to be efficient, e.g. fill forms at once, or chain actions where nothing changes on the page like saving, extracting, checkboxes...\n   - NEVER use multiple actions in a single step (otherwise ONLY the first action will be executed)\n\n9. Long tasks:\n- If the task is long keep track of the status in the memory. If the ultimate task requires multiple subinformation, keep track of the status in the memory\n\nFunctions:\n\n* \"click\" : Click on an element of the current page.

Analyze the provided webpage elements and structure\n2. Plan a sequence of actions to accomplish the given task\n3. Respond with valid JSON containing your action sequence and state assessment\n\nCurrent date and time: 2025-03-26 16:47:45\n\nINPUT STRUCTURE:\n1. Current URL: The webpage you're currently on\n2. Available Tabs: List of open browser tabs\n3. Interactive Elements: List in the format:\n   id[:]<element_type>element_text</element_type>\n   - `id`: identifier for interaction. `ids` can be decomposed into `<role_first_letter><index>[:]` where `<index>` is the index of the element in the list of elements with the same role and `<role_first_letter>` are:\n        - `I` for input fields (textbox, select, checkbox, etc.)\n        - `B` for buttons\n        - `L` for links\n        - `F` for figures and images\n        - `O` for options in select elements\n        - `M` for miscallaneous elements (e.g. modals, dialogs, etc.) that are only clickable for the most part.\n   - `element_type`: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)\n   - `element_text`: Visible text or element description\n\nExample:\nB1[:]<button>Submit Form</button>\n_[:] Non-interactive text\n\n\nNotes:\n- Only elements with `ids` are interactive\n- `_[:]` elements provide context but cannot be interacted with\n\n1. RESPONSE FORMAT: You must ALWAYS respond with valid JSON in this exact format:\n```json\n\n{\n  \"state\": {\n    \"page_summary\": \"On the page are company a,b,c wtih their revenue 1,2,3.\",\n    \"relevant_interactions\": [{\"id\": \"B2\", \"reason\": \"The button with id B2 represents search and I'm looking to search\"}],\n    \"previous_goal_status\": \"success|failure|unknown\",\n    \"previous_goal_eval\": \"Analyze the current elements and the image to check if the previous goals/actions are successful like intended by the task. Ignore the action result. The website is the ground truth. Also mention if something unexpected happened like new suggestions in an input field. Shortly state why/why not\",\n    \"memory\": \"Description of what has been done and what you need to remember until the end of the task\",\n    \"next_goal\": \"What needs to be done with the next actions\"\n  },\n  \"actions\": [\n   { \"one_action_name\": {\n      // action-specific parameter\n      ...\n   }\n   }, // ... more actions in sequence ...\n  ]\n}\n\n```\n\n\n2. ACTIONS: You are only allowed to chose one single action from the list to be executed.\n\nYou will find below some common actions sequences so that you can undertand the flow of some tasks.\nIDS presented in those sequences correspond to interactionable elements found in the page.\nYou might encounter the same ids, but never assume them to exist, or have the same role.\n\n   Common action sequences:\n   - Form filling:\n```json\n[\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I99\", \"value\": \"username\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I101\", \"value\": \"password\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"click\": {\"id\": \"B1\"}}\n]\n```\n   - Navigation and extraction:\n```json\n[\n  {\"goto\": {\"url\": \"https://www.google.com\"}},\n  {\"scrape\": {\"instructions\": null}}\n]\n```\n\nREMEMBER: You are NEVER allowed to specify multiple actions in the list of actions.\n\n\n3. ELEMENT INTERACTION:\n   - Only use `ids` that exist in the provided element list\n   - Each element has a unique `id` (e.g., `I2[:]<button>`)\n   - Elements marked with `_[:]` are non-interactive (for context only)\n\n4. NAVIGATION & ERROR HANDLING:\n   - If no suitable elements exist, use other functions to complete the task\n   - If stuck, try alternative approaches\n   - Handle popups/cookies by accepting or closing them\n   - Use scroll to find elements you are looking for\n\n5. TASK COMPLETION:\n   - Use the `completion` action as the last action as soon as the task is complete\n   - Don't hallucinate actions\n   - If the task requires specific information - make sure to include everything in the `completion` function. This is what the user will see.\n   - If you are running out of steps (current step), think about speeding it up, and ALWAYS use the `completion` action as the last action.\n   - Note that the `completion` can fail because an external validator failed to validate the output. If this happens, you should reflect on why the output is invalid and try to fix it.\n\n   - Example of sucessfuly `completion` action:\n```json\n[\n  {\"completion\": {\"success\": true, \"answer\": \"<answer to the task>\"}}\n]\n```\n\n6. VISUAL CONTEXT:\n   - When an image is provided, use it to understand the page layout\n   - Bounding boxes with labels correspond to element indexes\n   - Each bounding box and its label have the same color\n   - Most often the label is inside the bounding box, on the top right\n   - Visual context helps verify element locations and relationships\n   - sometimes labels overlap, so use the context to verify the correct element\n\n7. Form filling:\n   - If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often a list with suggestions popped up under the field and you need to first select the right element from the suggestion list.\n\n8. ACTION SEQUENCING:\n   - Actions are executed in the order they appear in the list\n   - Each action should logically follow from the previous one\n   - If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.\n   - If content only disappears the sequence continues.\n   - Only provide the action sequence until you think the page will change.\n   - Try to be efficient, e.g. fill forms at once, or chain actions where nothing changes on the page like saving, extracting, checkboxes...\n   - NEVER use multiple actions in a single step (otherwise ONLY the first action will be executed)\n\n9. Long tasks:\n- If the task is long keep track of the status in the memory. If the ultimate task requires multiple subinformation, keep track of the status in the memory\n\nFunctions:\n\n* \"click\" : Click on an element of the current page. Format:\n```json\n{\"click\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"list_dropdown_options\" : List all options of a dropdown.

Then you can either set the `value` field to the option's text or the `option_id` field to the option's `id`.. Format:\n```json\n{\"select_dropdown_option\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"option_id\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}, \"value\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"reload\" : Reload the current page.

Format:\n```json\n{\"scrape\": {\"instructions\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n\nRemember: Your responses must be valid JSON matching the specified format. Each action in the sequence must be valid.\n"

Despite advancements in large language models that incorporate visual data, such as GPT-4V, effectively translating image-based data into actionable outcomes for AI agents continues to be challenging. In this paper, we introduce a multimodal model that incorporates the concept of functional token specifically designed for AI agent applications. To ensure compatibility with edge devices, our model is optimized to a compact size of less than 1B parameters. Like GPT-4, our model can process both English and Chinese. We demonstrate that this model is capable of operating efficiently on a wide range of edge devices, including as constrained as a Raspberry Pi.\n_[:]Subjects:\n_[:]Computation and Language (cs.CL)\n_[:]; Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)\n_[:]Cite as:\nL11[:]<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11459\">arXiv:2404.11459</a>\n_[:][cs.CL]\n_[:](or\nL12[:]<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11459v2\">arXiv:2404.11459v2</a>\n_[:][cs.CL]\n_[:]for this version)\nL13[:]<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.11459\">https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.11459</a>\nB2[:]<button>Focus to learn more</button>\n_[:]Submission history\n_[:]From: Wei Chen [\nL14[:]<a href=\"/show-email/1fe43dbf/2404.11459\">view email</a>\n_[:]]\nL15[:]<a href=\"/abs/2404.11459v1\">[v1]</a>\n_[:]Wed, 17 Apr 2024 15:07:06 UTC (8,879 KB)\n_[:][v2]\n_[:]Thu, 18 Apr 2024 07:32:52 UTC (8,879 KB)\n_[:]Access Paper:\nL16[:]<a href=\"/pdf/2404.11459\">View PDF</a>\nL17[:]<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2404.11459v2\">HTML (experimental)</a>\nL18[:]<a href=\"/src/2404.11459\">TeX Source</a>\nL19[:]<a href=\"/format/2404.11459\">Other Formats</a>\nL20[:]<a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/\" title=\"Rights to this article\">view license</a>\nM1[:]<img src=\"https://arxiv.org/icons/licenses/by-nc-nd-4.0.png\" alt=\"license icon\" role=\"presentation\"></img>\n_[:]Current browse context:\n_[:]cs.CL\nL21[:]<a href=\"/prevnext?id=2404.11459&function=prev&context=cs.CL\" title=\"previous in cs.CL (accesskey p)\"><\u00a0prev</a>\n_[:]|\nL22[:]<a href=\"/prevnext?id=2404.11459&function=next&context=cs.CL\" title=\"next in cs.CL (accesskey n)\">next\u00a0></a>\nL23[:]<a href=\"/list/cs.CL/new\">new</a>\n_[:]|\nL24[:]<a href=\"/list/cs.CL/recent\">recent</a>\n_[:]|\nL25[:]<a href=\"/list/cs.CL/2024-04\">2024-04</a>\n_[:]Change to browse by:\nL26[:]<a href=\"/abs/2404.11459?context=cs\">cs</a>\nL27[:]<a href=\"/abs/2404.11459?context=cs.CV\">cs.CV</a>\n_[:]References & Citations\nL28[:]<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/arXiv:2404.11459\">NASA ADS</a>\nL29[:]<a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?arxiv_id=2404.1145...\">Google Scholar</a>\nL30[:]<a href=\"https://api.semanticscholar.org/arXiv:2404.11459\">Semantic Scholar</a>\n_[:]export BibTeX citation\n_[:]Bookmark\nL31[:]<a href=\"http://www.bibsonomy.org/BibtexHandler?requTask=upload&url=h...\" title=\"Bookmark on BibSonomy\"></a>\nF3[:]<img src=\"/static/browse/0.3.4/images/icons/social/bibsonomy.png\" alt=\"BibSonomy logo\"></img>\nL32[:]<a href=\"https://reddit.com/submit?url=https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.114...\" title=\"Bookmark on Reddit\"></a>\nF4[:]<img src=\"/static/browse/0.3.4/images/icons/social/reddit.png\" alt=\"Reddit logo\"></img>\nM2[:]<label>Bibliographic Tools</label>\n_[:]Bibliographic and Citation Tools\nM3[:]<label>Bibliographic Explorer Toggle</label>\n_[:]Bibliographic Explorer\n_[:](\nL33[:]<a href=\"https://info.arxiv.org/labs/showcase.html#arxiv-bibliographi...\">What is the Explorer?</a>\n_[:])\nM4[:]<label>Connected Papers Toggle</label>\n_[:]Connected Papers\n_[:](\nL34[:]<a href=\"https://www.connectedpapers.com/about\">What is Connected Papers?</a>\n_[:])\nM5[:]<label>Litmaps Toggle</label>\n_[:]Litmaps\n_[:](\nL35[:]<a href=\"https://www.litmaps.co/\">What is Litmaps?</a>\n_[:])\nM6[:]<label>scite.ai Toggle</label>\n_[:]scite Smart Citations\n_[:](\nL36[:]<a href=\"https://www.scite.ai/\">What are Smart Citations?</a>\n_[:])\nM7[:]<label>Code, Data, Media</label>\nM8[:]<label>Demos</label>\nM9[:]<label>Related Papers</label>\nM10[:]<label>About arXivLabs</label>\nL37[:]<a href=\"/auth/show-endorsers/2404.11459\">Which authors of this paper are endorsers?</a>\n_[:]|\nL38[:]<a href=\"javascript:setMathjaxCookie()\">Disable MathJax</a>\n_[:](\nL39[:]<a href=\"https://info.arxiv.org/help/mathjax.html\">What is MathJax?</a>\n_[:])\n... 247 pixels below - scroll or scrape content to see more ...\n[End of page]\n\n\n\n[Data found in the page]\n\n"

Respond with valid JSON containing your action sequence and state assessment\n\nCurrent date and time: 2025-03-26 16:47:50\n\nINPUT STRUCTURE:\n1. Current URL: The webpage you're currently on\n2. Available Tabs: List of open browser tabs\n3. Interactive Elements: List in the format:\n   id[:]<element_type>element_text</element_type>\n   - `id`: identifier for interaction. `ids` can be decomposed into `<role_first_letter><index>[:]` where `<index>` is the index of the element in the list of elements with the same role and `<role_first_letter>` are:\n        - `I` for input fields (textbox, select, checkbox, etc.)\n        - `B` for buttons\n        - `L` for links\n        - `F` for figures and images\n        - `O` for options in select elements\n        - `M` for miscallaneous elements (e.g. modals, dialogs, etc.) that are only clickable for the most part.\n   - `element_type`: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)\n   - `element_text`: Visible text or element description\n\nExample:\nB1[:]<button>Submit Form</button>\n_[:] Non-interactive text\n\n\nNotes:\n- Only elements with `ids` are interactive\n- `_[:]` elements provide context but cannot be interacted with\n\n1. RESPONSE FORMAT: You must ALWAYS respond with valid JSON in this exact format:\n```json\n\n{\n  \"state\": {\n    \"page_summary\": \"On the page are company a,b,c wtih their revenue 1,2,3.\",\n    \"relevant_interactions\": [{\"id\": \"B2\", \"reason\": \"The button with id B2 represents search and I'm looking to search\"}],\n    \"previous_goal_status\": \"success|failure|unknown\",\n    \"previous_goal_eval\": \"Analyze the current elements and the image to check if the previous goals/actions are successful like intended by the task.

ACTIONS: You are only allowed to chose one single action from the list to be executed.\n\nYou will find below some common actions sequences so that you can undertand the flow of some tasks.\nIDS presented in those sequences correspond to interactionable elements found in the page.\nYou might encounter the same ids, but never assume them to exist, or have the same role.\n\n   Common action sequences:\n   - Form filling:\n```json\n[\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I99\", \"value\": \"username\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I101\", \"value\": \"password\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"click\": {\"id\": \"B1\"}}\n]\n```\n   - Navigation and extraction:\n```json\n[\n  {\"goto\": {\"url\": \"https://www.google.com\"}},\n  {\"scrape\": {\"instructions\": null}}\n]\n```\n\nREMEMBER: You are NEVER allowed to specify multiple actions in the list of actions.\n\n\n3. ELEMENT INTERACTION:\n   - Only use `ids` that exist in the provided element list\n   - Each element has a unique `id` (e.g., `I2[:]<button>`)\n   - Elements marked with `_[:]` are non-interactive (for context only)\n\n4. NAVIGATION & ERROR HANDLING:\n   - If no suitable elements exist, use other functions to complete the task\n   - If stuck, try alternative approaches\n   - Handle popups/cookies by accepting or closing them\n   - Use scroll to find elements you are looking for\n\n5. TASK COMPLETION:\n   - Use the `completion` action as the last action as soon as the task is complete\n   - Don't hallucinate actions\n   - If the task requires specific information - make sure to include everything in the `completion` function. This is what the user will see.\n   - If you are running out of steps (current step), think about speeding it up, and ALWAYS use the `completion` action as the last action.\n   - Note that the `completion` can fail because an external validator failed to validate the output. If this happens, you should reflect on why the output is invalid and try to fix it.\n\n   - Example of sucessfuly `completion` action:\n```json\n[\n  {\"completion\": {\"success\": true, \"answer\": \"<answer to the task>\"}}\n]\n```\n\n6. VISUAL CONTEXT:\n   - When an image is provided, use it to understand the page layout\n   - Bounding boxes with labels correspond to element indexes\n   - Each bounding box and its label have the same color\n   - Most often the label is inside the bounding box, on the top right\n   - Visual context helps verify element locations and relationships\n   - sometimes labels overlap, so use the context to verify the correct element\n\n7. Form filling:\n   - If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often a list with suggestions popped up under the field and you need to first select the right element from the suggestion list.\n\n8. ACTION SEQUENCING:\n   - Actions are executed in the order they appear in the list\n   - Each action should logically follow from the previous one\n   - If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.\n   - If content only disappears the sequence continues.\n   - Only provide the action sequence until you think the page will change.\n   - Try to be efficient, e.g. fill forms at once, or chain actions where nothing changes on the page like saving, extracting, checkboxes...\n   - NEVER use multiple actions in a single step (otherwise ONLY the first action will be executed)\n\n9. Long tasks:\n- If the task is long keep track of the status in the memory. If the ultimate task requires multiple subinformation, keep track of the status in the memory\n\nFunctions:\n\n* \"click\" : Click on an element of the current page.

Respond with valid JSON containing your action sequence and state assessment\n\nCurrent date and time: 2025-03-26 16:47:55\n\nINPUT STRUCTURE:\n1. Current URL: The webpage you're currently on\n2. Available Tabs: List of open browser tabs\n3. Interactive Elements: List in the format:\n   id[:]<element_type>element_text</element_type>\n   - `id`: identifier for interaction. `ids` can be decomposed into `<role_first_letter><index>[:]` where `<index>` is the index of the element in the list of elements with the same role and `<role_first_letter>` are:\n        - `I` for input fields (textbox, select, checkbox, etc.)\n        - `B` for buttons\n        - `L` for links\n        - `F` for figures and images\n        - `O` for options in select elements\n        - `M` for miscallaneous elements (e.g. modals, dialogs, etc.) that are only clickable for the most part.\n   - `element_type`: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)\n   - `element_text`: Visible text or element description\n\nExample:\nB1[:]<button>Submit Form</button>\n_[:] Non-interactive text\n\n\nNotes:\n- Only elements with `ids` are interactive\n- `_[:]` elements provide context but cannot be interacted with\n\n1. RESPONSE FORMAT: You must ALWAYS respond with valid JSON in this exact format:\n```json\n\n{\n  \"state\": {\n    \"page_summary\": \"On the page are company a,b,c wtih their revenue 1,2,3.\",\n    \"relevant_interactions\": [{\"id\": \"B2\", \"reason\": \"The button with id B2 represents search and I'm looking to search\"}],\n    \"previous_goal_status\": \"success|failure|unknown\",\n    \"previous_goal_eval\": \"Analyze the current elements and the image to check if the previous goals/actions are successful like intended by the task.

ACTIONS: You are only allowed to chose one single action from the list to be executed.\n\nYou will find below some common actions sequences so that you can undertand the flow of some tasks.\nIDS presented in those sequences correspond to interactionable elements found in the page.\nYou might encounter the same ids, but never assume them to exist, or have the same role.\n\n   Common action sequences:\n   - Form filling:\n```json\n[\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I99\", \"value\": \"username\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I101\", \"value\": \"password\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"click\": {\"id\": \"B1\"}}\n]\n```\n   - Navigation and extraction:\n```json\n[\n  {\"goto\": {\"url\": \"https://www.google.com\"}},\n  {\"scrape\": {\"instructions\": null}}\n]\n```\n\nREMEMBER: You are NEVER allowed to specify multiple actions in the list of actions.\n\n\n3. ELEMENT INTERACTION:\n   - Only use `ids` that exist in the provided element list\n   - Each element has a unique `id` (e.g., `I2[:]<button>`)\n   - Elements marked with `_[:]` are non-interactive (for context only)\n\n4. NAVIGATION & ERROR HANDLING:\n   - If no suitable elements exist, use other functions to complete the task\n   - If stuck, try alternative approaches\n   - Handle popups/cookies by accepting or closing them\n   - Use scroll to find elements you are looking for\n\n5. TASK COMPLETION:\n   - Use the `completion` action as the last action as soon as the task is complete\n   - Don't hallucinate actions\n   - If the task requires specific information - make sure to include everything in the `completion` function. This is what the user will see.\n   - If you are running out of steps (current step), think about speeding it up, and ALWAYS use the `completion` action as the last action.\n   - Note that the `completion` can fail because an external validator failed to validate the output. If this happens, you should reflect on why the output is invalid and try to fix it.\n\n   - Example of sucessfuly `completion` action:\n```json\n[\n  {\"completion\": {\"success\": true, \"answer\": \"<answer to the task>\"}}\n]\n```\n\n6. VISUAL CONTEXT:\n   - When an image is provided, use it to understand the page layout\n   - Bounding boxes with labels correspond to element indexes\n   - Each bounding box and its label have the same color\n   - Most often the label is inside the bounding box, on the top right\n   - Visual context helps verify element locations and relationships\n   - sometimes labels overlap, so use the context to verify the correct element\n\n7. Form filling:\n   - If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often a list with suggestions popped up under the field and you need to first select the right element from the suggestion list.\n\n8. ACTION SEQUENCING:\n   - Actions are executed in the order they appear in the list\n   - Each action should logically follow from the previous one\n   - If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.\n   - If content only disappears the sequence continues.\n   - Only provide the action sequence until you think the page will change.\n   - Try to be efficient, e.g. fill forms at once, or chain actions where nothing changes on the page like saving, extracting, checkboxes...\n   - NEVER use multiple actions in a single step (otherwise ONLY the first action will be executed)\n\n9. Long tasks:\n- If the task is long keep track of the status in the memory. If the ultimate task requires multiple subinformation, keep track of the status in the memory\n\nFunctions:\n\n* \"click\" : Click on an element of the current page. Format:\n```json\n{\"click\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"list_dropdown_options\" : List all options of a dropdown.

Leading this evolution are proprietary LLMs like GPT-4 and GPT-o1, which have captured widespread attention in the AI community due to their remarkable performance and versatility. Simultaneously, open-source LLMs, such as LLaMA and Mistral, have made great contributions to the ever-increasing popularity of LLMs due to the ease to customize and deploy the models across diverse applications. Although open-source LLMs present unprecedented opportunities for innovation and research, the commercialization of LLMs has raised concerns about transparency, reproducibility, and safety. Many open-source LLMs fail to meet fundamental transparency requirements by withholding essential components like training code and data, and some use restrictive licenses whilst claiming to be \"open-source,\" which may hinder further innovations on LLMs. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Moxin 7B, a fully open-source LLM developed in accordance with the Model Openness Framework (MOF), a ranked classification system that evaluates AI models based on model completeness and openness, adhering to principles of open science, open source, open data, and open access. Our model achieves the highest MOF classification level of \"open science\" through the comprehensive release of pre-training code and configurations, training and fine-tuning datasets, and intermediate and final checkpoints. Experiments show that our model achieves superior performance in zero-shot evaluation compared with popular 7B models and performs competitively in few-shot evaluation.\n_[:]Subjects:\n_[:]Computation and Language (cs.CL)\n_[:]; Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Machine Learning (cs.LG)\n_[:]Cite as:\nL24[:]<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06845\">arXiv:2412.06845</a>\n_[:][cs.CL]\n_[:](or\nL25[:]<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06845v2\">arXiv:2412.06845v2</a>\n_[:][cs.CL]\n_[:]for this version)\nL26[:]<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2412.06845\">https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2412.06845</a>\nB2[:]<button>Focus to learn more</button>\n_[:]Submission history\n_[:]From: Pu Zhao [\nL27[:]<a href=\"/show-email/8576465a/2412.06845\">view email</a>\n_[:]]\nL28[:]<a href=\"/abs/2412.06845v1\">[v1]</a>\n_[:]Sun, 8 Dec 2024 02:01:46 UTC (139 KB)\n_[:][v2]\n_[:]Wed, 11 Dec 2024 19:03:58 UTC (142 KB)\n_[:]Access Paper:\nL29[:]<a href=\"/pdf/2412.06845\">View PDF</a>\nL30[:]<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2412.06845v2\">HTML (experimental)</a>\nL31[:]<a href=\"/src/2412.06845\">TeX Source</a>\nL32[:]<a href=\"/format/2412.06845\">Other Formats</a>\nL33[:]<a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\" title=\"Rights to this article\">view license</a>\nM1[:]<img src=\"https://arxiv.org/icons/licenses/by-4.0.png\" alt=\"license icon\" role=\"presentation\"></img>\n_[:]Current browse context:\n_[:]cs.CL\nL34[:]<a href=\"/prevnext?id=2412.06845&function=prev&context=cs.CL\" title=\"previous in cs.CL (accesskey p)\"><\u00a0prev</a>\n_[:]|\nL35[:]<a href=\"/prevnext?id=2412.06845&function=next&context=cs.CL\" title=\"next in cs.CL (accesskey n)\">next\u00a0></a>\nL36[:]<a href=\"/list/cs.CL/new\">new</a>\n_[:]|\nL37[:]<a href=\"/list/cs.CL/recent\">recent</a>\n_[:]|\nL38[:]<a href=\"/list/cs.CL/2024-12\">2024-12</a>\n_[:]Change to browse by:\nL39[:]<a href=\"/abs/2412.06845?context=cs\">cs</a>\nL40[:]<a href=\"/abs/2412.06845?context=cs.AI\">cs.AI</a>\nL41[:]<a href=\"/abs/2412.06845?context=cs.LG\">cs.LG</a>\n_[:]References & Citations\nL42[:]<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/arXiv:2412.06845\">NASA ADS</a>\nL43[:]<a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?arxiv_id=2412.0684...\">Google Scholar</a>\nL44[:]<a href=\"https://api.semanticscholar.org/arXiv:2412.06845\">Semantic Scholar</a>\n_[:]export BibTeX citation\n_[:]Bookmark\nL45[:]<a href=\"http://www.bibsonomy.org/BibtexHandler?requTask=upload&url=h...\" title=\"Bookmark on BibSonomy\"></a>\nF3[:]<img src=\"/static/browse/0.3.4/images/icons/social/bibsonomy.png\" alt=\"BibSonomy logo\"></img>\nL46[:]<a href=\"https://reddit.com/submit?url=https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.068...\" title=\"Bookmark on Reddit\"></a>\nF4[:]<img src=\"/static/browse/0.3.4/images/icons/social/reddit.png\" alt=\"Reddit logo\"></img>\nM2[:]<label>Bibliographic Tools</label>\n_[:]Bibliographic and Citation Tools\nM3[:]<label>Bibliographic Explorer Toggle</label>\n_[:]Bibliographic Explorer\n_[:](\nL47[:]<a href=\"https://info.arxiv.org/labs/showcase.html#arxiv-bibliographi...\">What is the Explorer?</a>\n_[:])\nM4[:]<label>Connected Papers Toggle</label>\n_[:]Connected Papers\n_[:](\nL48[:]<a href=\"https://www.connectedpapers.com/about\">What is Connected Papers?</a>\n_[:])\nM5[:]<label>Litmaps Toggle</label>\n_[:]Litmaps\n_[:](\nL49[:]<a href=\"https://www.litmaps.co/\">What is Litmaps?</a>\n_[:])\nM6[:]<label>Code, Data, Media</label>\nM7[:]<label>Demos</label>\nM8[:]<label>Related Papers</label>\nM9[:]<label>About arXivLabs</label>\n... 398 pixels below - scroll or scrape content to see more ...\n[End of page]\n\n\n\n[Data found in the page]\n\n"

Available Tabs: List of open browser tabs\n3. Interactive Elements: List in the format:\n   id[:]<element_type>element_text</element_type>\n   - `id`: identifier for interaction. `ids` can be decomposed into `<role_first_letter><index>[:]` where `<index>` is the index of the element in the list of elements with the same role and `<role_first_letter>` are:\n        - `I` for input fields (textbox, select, checkbox, etc.)\n        - `B` for buttons\n        - `L` for links\n        - `F` for figures and images\n        - `O` for options in select elements\n        - `M` for miscallaneous elements (e.g. modals, dialogs, etc.) that are only clickable for the most part.\n   - `element_type`: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)\n   - `element_text`: Visible text or element description\n\nExample:\nB1[:]<button>Submit Form</button>\n_[:] Non-interactive text\n\n\nNotes:\n- Only elements with `ids` are interactive\n- `_[:]` elements provide context but cannot be interacted with\n\n1. RESPONSE FORMAT: You must ALWAYS respond with valid JSON in this exact format:\n```json\n\n{\n  \"state\": {\n    \"page_summary\": \"On the page are company a,b,c wtih their revenue 1,2,3.\",\n    \"relevant_interactions\": [{\"id\": \"B2\", \"reason\": \"The button with id B2 represents search and I'm looking to search\"}],\n    \"previous_goal_status\": \"success|failure|unknown\",\n    \"previous_goal_eval\": \"Analyze the current elements and the image to check if the previous goals/actions are successful like intended by the task.

ACTIONS: You are only allowed to chose one single action from the list to be executed.\n\nYou will find below some common actions sequences so that you can undertand the flow of some tasks.\nIDS presented in those sequences correspond to interactionable elements found in the page.\nYou might encounter the same ids, but never assume them to exist, or have the same role.\n\n   Common action sequences:\n   - Form filling:\n```json\n[\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I99\", \"value\": \"username\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I101\", \"value\": \"password\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"click\": {\"id\": \"B1\"}}\n]\n```\n   - Navigation and extraction:\n```json\n[\n  {\"goto\": {\"url\": \"https://www.google.com\"}},\n  {\"scrape\": {\"instructions\": null}}\n]\n```\n\nREMEMBER: You are NEVER allowed to specify multiple actions in the list of actions.\n\n\n3. ELEMENT INTERACTION:\n   - Only use `ids` that exist in the provided element list\n   - Each element has a unique `id` (e.g., `I2[:]<button>`)\n   - Elements marked with `_[:]` are non-interactive (for context only)\n\n4. NAVIGATION & ERROR HANDLING:\n   - If no suitable elements exist, use other functions to complete the task\n   - If stuck, try alternative approaches\n   - Handle popups/cookies by accepting or closing them\n   - Use scroll to find elements you are looking for\n\n5. TASK COMPLETION:\n   - Use the `completion` action as the last action as soon as the task is complete\n   - Don't hallucinate actions\n   - If the task requires specific information - make sure to include everything in the `completion` function. This is what the user will see.\n   - If you are running out of steps (current step), think about speeding it up, and ALWAYS use the `completion` action as the last action.\n   - Note that the `completion` can fail because an external validator failed to validate the output. If this happens, you should reflect on why the output is invalid and try to fix it.\n\n   - Example of sucessfuly `completion` action:\n```json\n[\n  {\"completion\": {\"success\": true, \"answer\": \"<answer to the task>\"}}\n]\n```\n\n6. VISUAL CONTEXT:\n   - When an image is provided, use it to understand the page layout\n   - Bounding boxes with labels correspond to element indexes\n   - Each bounding box and its label have the same color\n   - Most often the label is inside the bounding box, on the top right\n   - Visual context helps verify element locations and relationships\n   - sometimes labels overlap, so use the context to verify the correct element\n\n7. Form filling:\n   - If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often a list with suggestions popped up under the field and you need to first select the right element from the suggestion list.\n\n8. ACTION SEQUENCING:\n   - Actions are executed in the order they appear in the list\n   - Each action should logically follow from the previous one\n   - If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.\n   - If content only disappears the sequence continues.\n   - Only provide the action sequence until you think the page will change.\n   - Try to be efficient, e.g. fill forms at once, or chain actions where nothing changes on the page like saving, extracting, checkboxes...\n   - NEVER use multiple actions in a single step (otherwise ONLY the first action will be executed)\n\n9. Long tasks:\n- If the task is long keep track of the status in the memory. If the ultimate task requires multiple subinformation, keep track of the status in the memory\n\nFunctions:\n\n* \"click\" : Click on an element of the current page. Format:\n```json\n{\"click\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"list_dropdown_options\" : List all options of a dropdown.

Leading this evolution are proprietary LLMs like GPT-4 and GPT-o1, which have captured widespread attention in the AI community due to their remarkable performance and versatility. Simultaneously, open-source LLMs, such as LLaMA and Mistral, have made great contributions to the ever-increasing popularity of LLMs due to the ease to customize and deploy the models across diverse applications. Although open-source LLMs present unprecedented opportunities for innovation and research, the commercialization of LLMs has raised concerns about transparency, reproducibility, and safety. Many open-source LLMs fail to meet fundamental transparency requirements by withholding essential components like training code and data, and some use restrictive licenses whilst claiming to be \"open-source,\" which may hinder further innovations on LLMs. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Moxin 7B, a fully open-source LLM developed in accordance with the Model Openness Framework (MOF), a ranked classification system that evaluates AI models based on model completeness and openness, adhering to principles of open science, open source, open data, and open access. Our model achieves the highest MOF classification level of \"open science\" through the comprehensive release of pre-training code and configurations, training and fine-tuning datasets, and intermediate and final checkpoints. Experiments show that our model achieves superior performance in zero-shot evaluation compared with popular 7B models and performs competitively in few-shot evaluation.\n_[:]Subjects:\n_[:]Computation and Language (cs.CL)\n_[:]; Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Machine Learning (cs.LG)\n_[:]Cite as:\nL24[:]<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06845\">arXiv:2412.06845</a>\n_[:][cs.CL]\n_[:](or\nL25[:]<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06845v2\">arXiv:2412.06845v2</a>\n_[:][cs.CL]\n_[:]for this version)\nL26[:]<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2412.06845\">https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2412.06845</a>\nB2[:]<button>Focus to learn more</button>\n_[:]Submission history\n_[:]From: Pu Zhao [\nL27[:]<a href=\"/show-email/8576465a/2412.06845\">view email</a>\n_[:]]\nL28[:]<a href=\"/abs/2412.06845v1\">[v1]</a>\n_[:]Sun, 8 Dec 2024 02:01:46 UTC (139 KB)\n_[:][v2]\n_[:]Wed, 11 Dec 2024 19:03:58 UTC (142 KB)\n_[:]Access Paper:\nL29[:]<a href=\"/pdf/2412.06845\">View PDF</a>\nL30[:]<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2412.06845v2\">HTML (experimental)</a>\nL31[:]<a href=\"/src/2412.06845\">TeX Source</a>\nL32[:]<a href=\"/format/2412.06845\">Other Formats</a>\nL33[:]<a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\" title=\"Rights to this article\">view license</a>\nM1[:]<img src=\"https://arxiv.org/icons/licenses/by-4.0.png\" alt=\"license icon\" role=\"presentation\"></img>\n_[:]Current browse context:\n_[:]cs.CL\nL34[:]<a href=\"/prevnext?id=2412.06845&function=prev&context=cs.CL\" title=\"previous in cs.CL (accesskey p)\"><\u00a0prev</a>\n_[:]|\nL35[:]<a href=\"/prevnext?id=2412.06845&function=next&context=cs.CL\" title=\"next in cs.CL (accesskey n)\">next\u00a0></a>\nL36[:]<a href=\"/list/cs.CL/new\">new</a>\n_[:]|\nL37[:]<a href=\"/list/cs.CL/recent\">recent</a>\n_[:]|\nL38[:]<a href=\"/list/cs.CL/2024-12\">2024-12</a>\n_[:]Change to browse by:\nL39[:]<a href=\"/abs/2412.06845?context=cs\">cs</a>\nL40[:]<a href=\"/abs/2412.06845?context=cs.AI\">cs.AI</a>\nL41[:]<a href=\"/abs/2412.06845?context=cs.LG\">cs.LG</a>\n_[:]References & Citations\nL42[:]<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/arXiv:2412.06845\">NASA ADS</a>\nL43[:]<a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?arxiv_id=2412.0684...\">Google Scholar</a>\nL44[:]<a href=\"https://api.semanticscholar.org/arXiv:2412.06845\">Semantic Scholar</a>\n_[:]export BibTeX citation\n_[:]Bookmark\nL45[:]<a href=\"http://www.bibsonomy.org/BibtexHandler?requTask=upload&url=h...\" title=\"Bookmark on BibSonomy\"></a>\nF3[:]<img src=\"/static/browse/0.3.4/images/icons/social/bibsonomy.png\" alt=\"BibSonomy logo\"></img>\nL46[:]<a href=\"https://reddit.com/submit?url=https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.068...\" title=\"Bookmark on Reddit\"></a>\nF4[:]<img src=\"/static/browse/0.3.4/images/icons/social/reddit.png\" alt=\"Reddit logo\"></img>\nM2[:]<label>Bibliographic Tools</label>\n_[:]Bibliographic and Citation Tools\nM3[:]<label>Bibliographic Explorer Toggle</label>\n_[:]Bibliographic Explorer\n_[:](\nL47[:]<a href=\"https://info.arxiv.org/labs/showcase.html#arxiv-bibliographi...\">What is the Explorer?</a>\n_[:])\nM4[:]<label>Connected Papers Toggle</label>\n_[:]Connected Papers\n_[:](\nL48[:]<a href=\"https://www.connectedpapers.com/about\">What is Connected Papers?</a>\n_[:])\nM5[:]<label>Litmaps Toggle</label>\n_[:]Litmaps\n_[:](\nL49[:]<a href=\"https://www.litmaps.co/\">What is Litmaps?</a>\n_[:])\nM6[:]<label>Code, Data, Media</label>\nM7[:]<label>Demos</label>\nM8[:]<label>Related Papers</label>\nM9[:]<label>About arXivLabs</label>\n... 398 pixels below - scroll or scrape content to see more ...\n[End of page]\n\n\n\n[Data found in the page]\n\n"

Available Tabs: List of open browser tabs\n3. Interactive Elements: List in the format:\n   id[:]<element_type>element_text</element_type>\n   - `id`: identifier for interaction. `ids` can be decomposed into `<role_first_letter><index>[:]` where `<index>` is the index of the element in the list of elements with the same role and `<role_first_letter>` are:\n        - `I` for input fields (textbox, select, checkbox, etc.)\n        - `B` for buttons\n        - `L` for links\n        - `F` for figures and images\n        - `O` for options in select elements\n        - `M` for miscallaneous elements (e.g. modals, dialogs, etc.) that are only clickable for the most part.\n   - `element_type`: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)\n   - `element_text`: Visible text or element description\n\nExample:\nB1[:]<button>Submit Form</button>\n_[:] Non-interactive text\n\n\nNotes:\n- Only elements with `ids` are interactive\n- `_[:]` elements provide context but cannot be interacted with\n\n1. RESPONSE FORMAT: You must ALWAYS respond with valid JSON in this exact format:\n```json\n\n{\n  \"state\": {\n    \"page_summary\": \"On the page are company a,b,c wtih their revenue 1,2,3.\",\n    \"relevant_interactions\": [{\"id\": \"B2\", \"reason\": \"The button with id B2 represents search and I'm looking to search\"}],\n    \"previous_goal_status\": \"success|failure|unknown\",\n    \"previous_goal_eval\": \"Analyze the current elements and the image to check if the previous goals/actions are successful like intended by the task.

ACTIONS: You are only allowed to chose one single action from the list to be executed.\n\nYou will find below some common actions sequences so that you can undertand the flow of some tasks.\nIDS presented in those sequences correspond to interactionable elements found in the page.\nYou might encounter the same ids, but never assume them to exist, or have the same role.\n\n   Common action sequences:\n   - Form filling:\n```json\n[\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I99\", \"value\": \"username\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I101\", \"value\": \"password\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"click\": {\"id\": \"B1\"}}\n]\n```\n   - Navigation and extraction:\n```json\n[\n  {\"goto\": {\"url\": \"https://www.google.com\"}},\n  {\"scrape\": {\"instructions\": null}}\n]\n```\n\nREMEMBER: You are NEVER allowed to specify multiple actions in the list of actions.\n\n\n3. ELEMENT INTERACTION:\n   - Only use `ids` that exist in the provided element list\n   - Each element has a unique `id` (e.g., `I2[:]<button>`)\n   - Elements marked with `_[:]` are non-interactive (for context only)\n\n4. NAVIGATION & ERROR HANDLING:\n   - If no suitable elements exist, use other functions to complete the task\n   - If stuck, try alternative approaches\n   - Handle popups/cookies by accepting or closing them\n   - Use scroll to find elements you are looking for\n\n5. TASK COMPLETION:\n   - Use the `completion` action as the last action as soon as the task is complete\n   - Don't hallucinate actions\n   - If the task requires specific information - make sure to include everything in the `completion` function. This is what the user will see.\n   - If you are running out of steps (current step), think about speeding it up, and ALWAYS use the `completion` action as the last action.\n   - Note that the `completion` can fail because an external validator failed to validate the output. If this happens, you should reflect on why the output is invalid and try to fix it.\n\n   - Example of sucessfuly `completion` action:\n```json\n[\n  {\"completion\": {\"success\": true, \"answer\": \"<answer to the task>\"}}\n]\n```\n\n6. VISUAL CONTEXT:\n   - When an image is provided, use it to understand the page layout\n   - Bounding boxes with labels correspond to element indexes\n   - Each bounding box and its label have the same color\n   - Most often the label is inside the bounding box, on the top right\n   - Visual context helps verify element locations and relationships\n   - sometimes labels overlap, so use the context to verify the correct element\n\n7. Form filling:\n   - If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often a list with suggestions popped up under the field and you need to first select the right element from the suggestion list.\n\n8. ACTION SEQUENCING:\n   - Actions are executed in the order they appear in the list\n   - Each action should logically follow from the previous one\n   - If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.\n   - If content only disappears the sequence continues.\n   - Only provide the action sequence until you think the page will change.\n   - Try to be efficient, e.g. fill forms at once, or chain actions where nothing changes on the page like saving, extracting, checkboxes...\n   - NEVER use multiple actions in a single step (otherwise ONLY the first action will be executed)\n\n9. Long tasks:\n- If the task is long keep track of the status in the memory. If the ultimate task requires multiple subinformation, keep track of the status in the memory\n\nFunctions:\n\n* \"click\" : Click on an element of the current page.

Then you can either set the `value` field to the option's text or the `option_id` field to the option's `id`.. Format:\n```json\n{\"select_dropdown_option\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"option_id\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}, \"value\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"reload\" : Reload the current page. Format:\n```json\n{\"reload\": {}}\n```\n\n* \"scrape\" : Scrape the current page data in text format. If `instructions` is null then the whole page will be scraped. Otherwise, only the data that matches the instructions will be scraped. Instructions should be given as natural language, e.g. 'Extract the title and the price of the product'. Format:\n```json\n{\"scrape\": {\"instructions\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n\nRemember: Your responses must be valid JSON matching the specified format. Each action in the sequence must be valid.\n"

Analyze the provided webpage elements and structure\n2. Plan a sequence of actions to accomplish the given task\n3. Respond with valid JSON containing your action sequence and state assessment\n\nCurrent date and time: 2025-03-26 16:48:15\n\nINPUT STRUCTURE:\n1. Current URL: The webpage you're currently on\n2. Available Tabs: List of open browser tabs\n3. Interactive Elements: List in the format:\n   id[:]<element_type>element_text</element_type>\n   - `id`: identifier for interaction. `ids` can be decomposed into `<role_first_letter><index>[:]` where `<index>` is the index of the element in the list of elements with the same role and `<role_first_letter>` are:\n        - `I` for input fields (textbox, select, checkbox, etc.)\n        - `B` for buttons\n        - `L` for links\n        - `F` for figures and images\n        - `O` for options in select elements\n        - `M` for miscallaneous elements (e.g. modals, dialogs, etc.) that are only clickable for the most part.\n   - `element_type`: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)\n   - `element_text`: Visible text or element description\n\nExample:\nB1[:]<button>Submit Form</button>\n_[:] Non-interactive text\n\n\nNotes:\n- Only elements with `ids` are interactive\n- `_[:]` elements provide context but cannot be interacted with\n\n1. RESPONSE FORMAT: You must ALWAYS respond with valid JSON in this exact format:\n```json\n\n{\n  \"state\": {\n    \"page_summary\": \"On the page are company a,b,c wtih their revenue 1,2,3.\",\n    \"relevant_interactions\": [{\"id\": \"B2\", \"reason\": \"The button with id B2 represents search and I'm looking to search\"}],\n    \"previous_goal_status\": \"success|failure|unknown\",\n    \"previous_goal_eval\": \"Analyze the current elements and the image to check if the previous goals/actions are successful like intended by the task. Ignore the action result. The website is the ground truth. Also mention if something unexpected happened like new suggestions in an input field. Shortly state why/why not\",\n    \"memory\": \"Description of what has been done and what you need to remember until the end of the task\",\n    \"next_goal\": \"What needs to be done with the next actions\"\n  },\n  \"actions\": [\n   { \"one_action_name\": {\n      // action-specific parameter\n      ...\n   }\n   }, // ... more actions in sequence ...\n  ]\n}\n\n```\n\n\n2. ACTIONS: You are only allowed to chose one single action from the list to be executed.\n\nYou will find below some common actions sequences so that you can undertand the flow of some tasks.\nIDS presented in those sequences correspond to interactionable elements found in the page.\nYou might encounter the same ids, but never assume them to exist, or have the same role.\n\n   Common action sequences:\n   - Form filling:\n```json\n[\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I99\", \"value\": \"username\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I101\", \"value\": \"password\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"click\": {\"id\": \"B1\"}}\n]\n```\n   - Navigation and extraction:\n```json\n[\n  {\"goto\": {\"url\": \"https://www.google.com\"}},\n  {\"scrape\": {\"instructions\": null}}\n]\n```\n\nREMEMBER: You are NEVER allowed to specify multiple actions in the list of actions.\n\n\n3. ELEMENT INTERACTION:\n   - Only use `ids` that exist in the provided element list\n   - Each element has a unique `id` (e.g., `I2[:]<button>`)\n   - Elements marked with `_[:]` are non-interactive (for context only)\n\n4. NAVIGATION & ERROR HANDLING:\n   - If no suitable elements exist, use other functions to complete the task\n   - If stuck, try alternative approaches\n   - Handle popups/cookies by accepting or closing them\n   - Use scroll to find elements you are looking for\n\n5. TASK COMPLETION:\n   - Use the `completion` action as the last action as soon as the task is complete\n   - Don't hallucinate actions\n   - If the task requires specific information - make sure to include everything in the `completion` function. This is what the user will see.\n   - If you are running out of steps (current step), think about speeding it up, and ALWAYS use the `completion` action as the last action.\n   - Note that the `completion` can fail because an external validator failed to validate the output. If this happens, you should reflect on why the output is invalid and try to fix it.\n\n   - Example of sucessfuly `completion` action:\n```json\n[\n  {\"completion\": {\"success\": true, \"answer\": \"<answer to the task>\"}}\n]\n```\n\n6. VISUAL CONTEXT:\n   - When an image is provided, use it to understand the page layout\n   - Bounding boxes with labels correspond to element indexes\n   - Each bounding box and its label have the same color\n   - Most often the label is inside the bounding box, on the top right\n   - Visual context helps verify element locations and relationships\n   - sometimes labels overlap, so use the context to verify the correct element\n\n7. Form filling:\n   - If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often a list with suggestions popped up under the field and you need to first select the right element from the suggestion list.\n\n8. ACTION SEQUENCING:\n   - Actions are executed in the order they appear in the list\n   - Each action should logically follow from the previous one\n   - If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.\n   - If content only disappears the sequence continues.\n   - Only provide the action sequence until you think the page will change.\n   - Try to be efficient, e.g. fill forms at once, or chain actions where nothing changes on the page like saving, extracting, checkboxes...\n   - NEVER use multiple actions in a single step (otherwise ONLY the first action will be executed)\n\n9. Long tasks:\n- If the task is long keep track of the status in the memory. If the ultimate task requires multiple subinformation, keep track of the status in the memory\n\nFunctions:\n\n* \"click\" : Click on an element of the current page. Format:\n```json\n{\"click\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"list_dropdown_options\" : List all options of a dropdown.

Then you can either set the `value` field to the option's text or the `option_id` field to the option's `id`.. Format:\n```json\n{\"select_dropdown_option\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"option_id\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}, \"value\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"reload\" : Reload the current page.

Format:\n```json\n{\"scrape\": {\"instructions\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n\nRemember: Your responses must be valid JSON matching the specified format. Each action in the sequence must be valid.\n"

Our browser-based Minecraft testbed allows for rapid testing of collaborative agents in a continuous-space, real-time, partially-observable environment with real humans without cumbersome setup typical to human-AI interaction user studies. As Minecraft has an extensive player base and a rich ecosystem of pre-built AI agents, we hope this contribution can help to facilitate research quickly in the design of new collaborative agents and in understanding different human factors within HMT. Our mental model alignment tool facilitates user-led post-mission analysis by including video displays of first-person perspectives of the team members (i.e., the human and AI) that can be replayed, and a chat interface that leverages GPT-4 to provide answers to various queries regarding the AI's experiences and model details.\n_[:]Comments:\n_[:]Accepted to the Cooperative Multi-Agent Systems Decision-making and Learning:Human-Multi-Agent Cognitive Fusion Workshop at AAAI 2025\n_[:]Subjects:\n_[:]Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC)\n_[:]; Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)\n_[:]Cite as:\nL14[:]<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19607\">arXiv:2503.19607</a>\n_[:][cs.HC]\n_[:](or\nL15[:]<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19607v1\">arXiv:2503.19607v1</a>\n_[:][cs.HC]\n_[:]for this version)\nL16[:]<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2503.19607\">https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2503.19607</a>\nB2[:]<button>Focus to learn more</button>\n_[:]Submission history\n_[:]From: Rohan Paleja [\nL17[:]<a href=\"/show-email/c278c9c9/2503.19607\">view email</a>\n_[:]]\n_[:][v1]\n_[:]Tue, 25 Mar 2025 12:43:18 UTC (5,465 KB)\n_[:]Access Paper:\nL18[:]<a href=\"/pdf/2503.19607\">View PDF</a>\nL19[:]<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19607v1\">HTML (experimental)</a>\nL20[:]<a href=\"/src/2503.19607\">TeX Source</a>\nL21[:]<a href=\"/format/2503.19607\">Other Formats</a>\nL22[:]<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/\" title=\"Rights to this article\">view license</a>\n_[:]Current browse context:\n_[:]cs.HC\nL23[:]<a href=\"/prevnext?id=2503.19607&function=prev&context=cs.HC\" title=\"previous in cs.HC (accesskey p)\"><\u00a0prev</a>\n_[:]|\nL24[:]<a href=\"/prevnext?id=2503.19607&function=next&context=cs.HC\" title=\"next in cs.HC (accesskey n)\">next\u00a0></a>\nL25[:]<a href=\"/list/cs.HC/new\">new</a>\n_[:]|\nL26[:]<a href=\"/list/cs.HC/recent\">recent</a>\n_[:]|\nL27[:]<a href=\"/list/cs.HC/2025-03\">2025-03</a>\n_[:]Change to browse by:\nL28[:]<a href=\"/abs/2503.19607?context=cs\">cs</a>\nL29[:]<a href=\"/abs/2503.19607?context=cs.AI\">cs.AI</a>\n_[:]References & Citations\nL30[:]<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/arXiv:2503.19607\">NASA ADS</a>\nL31[:]<a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?arxiv_id=2503.1960...\">Google Scholar</a>\nL32[:]<a href=\"https://api.semanticscholar.org/arXiv:2503.19607\">Semantic Scholar</a>\n_[:]export BibTeX citation\n_[:]Bookmark\nL33[:]<a href=\"http://www.bibsonomy.org/BibtexHandler?requTask=upload&url=h...\" title=\"Bookmark on BibSonomy\"></a>\nF3[:]<img src=\"/static/browse/0.3.4/images/icons/social/bibsonomy.png\" alt=\"BibSonomy logo\"></img>\nL34[:]<a href=\"https://reddit.com/submit?url=https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.196...\" title=\"Bookmark on Reddit\"></a>\nF4[:]<img src=\"/static/browse/0.3.4/images/icons/social/reddit.png\" alt=\"Reddit logo\"></img>\nM1[:]<label>Bibliographic Tools</label>\n_[:]Bibliographic and Citation Tools\nM2[:]<label>Bibliographic Explorer Toggle</label>\n_[:]Bibliographic Explorer\n_[:](\nL35[:]<a href=\"https://info.arxiv.org/labs/showcase.html#arxiv-bibliographi...\">What is the Explorer?</a>\n_[:])\nM3[:]<label>Connected Papers Toggle</label>\n_[:]Connected Papers\n_[:](\nL36[:]<a href=\"https://www.connectedpapers.com/about\">What is Connected Papers?</a>\n_[:])\nM4[:]<label>Litmaps Toggle</label>\n_[:]Litmaps\n_[:](\nL37[:]<a href=\"https://www.litmaps.co/\">What is Litmaps?</a>\n_[:])\nM5[:]<label>scite.ai Toggle</label>\n_[:]scite Smart Citations\n_[:](\nL38[:]<a href=\"https://www.scite.ai/\">What are Smart Citations?</a>\n_[:])\nM6[:]<label>Code, Data, Media</label>\nM7[:]<label>Demos</label>\nM8[:]<label>Related Papers</label>\nM9[:]<label>About arXivLabs</label>\n... 318 pixels below - scroll or scrape content to see more ...\n[End of page]\n\n\n\n[Data found in the page]\n\n"

Analyze the provided webpage elements and structure\n2. Plan a sequence of actions to accomplish the given task\n3. Respond with valid JSON containing your action sequence and state assessment\n\nCurrent date and time: 2025-03-26 16:48:19\n\nINPUT STRUCTURE:\n1. Current URL: The webpage you're currently on\n2. Available Tabs: List of open browser tabs\n3. Interactive Elements: List in the format:\n   id[:]<element_type>element_text</element_type>\n   - `id`: identifier for interaction. `ids` can be decomposed into `<role_first_letter><index>[:]` where `<index>` is the index of the element in the list of elements with the same role and `<role_first_letter>` are:\n        - `I` for input fields (textbox, select, checkbox, etc.)\n        - `B` for buttons\n        - `L` for links\n        - `F` for figures and images\n        - `O` for options in select elements\n        - `M` for miscallaneous elements (e.g. modals, dialogs, etc.) that are only clickable for the most part.\n   - `element_type`: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)\n   - `element_text`: Visible text or element description\n\nExample:\nB1[:]<button>Submit Form</button>\n_[:] Non-interactive text\n\n\nNotes:\n- Only elements with `ids` are interactive\n- `_[:]` elements provide context but cannot be interacted with\n\n1. RESPONSE FORMAT: You must ALWAYS respond with valid JSON in this exact format:\n```json\n\n{\n  \"state\": {\n    \"page_summary\": \"On the page are company a,b,c wtih their revenue 1,2,3.\",\n    \"relevant_interactions\": [{\"id\": \"B2\", \"reason\": \"The button with id B2 represents search and I'm looking to search\"}],\n    \"previous_goal_status\": \"success|failure|unknown\",\n    \"previous_goal_eval\": \"Analyze the current elements and the image to check if the previous goals/actions are successful like intended by the task.

ACTIONS: You are only allowed to chose one single action from the list to be executed.\n\nYou will find below some common actions sequences so that you can undertand the flow of some tasks.\nIDS presented in those sequences correspond to interactionable elements found in the page.\nYou might encounter the same ids, but never assume them to exist, or have the same role.\n\n   Common action sequences:\n   - Form filling:\n```json\n[\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I99\", \"value\": \"username\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I101\", \"value\": \"password\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"click\": {\"id\": \"B1\"}}\n]\n```\n   - Navigation and extraction:\n```json\n[\n  {\"goto\": {\"url\": \"https://www.google.com\"}},\n  {\"scrape\": {\"instructions\": null}}\n]\n```\n\nREMEMBER: You are NEVER allowed to specify multiple actions in the list of actions.\n\n\n3. ELEMENT INTERACTION:\n   - Only use `ids` that exist in the provided element list\n   - Each element has a unique `id` (e.g., `I2[:]<button>`)\n   - Elements marked with `_[:]` are non-interactive (for context only)\n\n4. NAVIGATION & ERROR HANDLING:\n   - If no suitable elements exist, use other functions to complete the task\n   - If stuck, try alternative approaches\n   - Handle popups/cookies by accepting or closing them\n   - Use scroll to find elements you are looking for\n\n5. TASK COMPLETION:\n   - Use the `completion` action as the last action as soon as the task is complete\n   - Don't hallucinate actions\n   - If the task requires specific information - make sure to include everything in the `completion` function. This is what the user will see.\n   - If you are running out of steps (current step), think about speeding it up, and ALWAYS use the `completion` action as the last action.\n   - Note that the `completion` can fail because an external validator failed to validate the output. If this happens, you should reflect on why the output is invalid and try to fix it.\n\n   - Example of sucessfuly `completion` action:\n```json\n[\n  {\"completion\": {\"success\": true, \"answer\": \"<answer to the task>\"}}\n]\n```\n\n6. VISUAL CONTEXT:\n   - When an image is provided, use it to understand the page layout\n   - Bounding boxes with labels correspond to element indexes\n   - Each bounding box and its label have the same color\n   - Most often the label is inside the bounding box, on the top right\n   - Visual context helps verify element locations and relationships\n   - sometimes labels overlap, so use the context to verify the correct element\n\n7. Form filling:\n   - If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often a list with suggestions popped up under the field and you need to first select the right element from the suggestion list.\n\n8. ACTION SEQUENCING:\n   - Actions are executed in the order they appear in the list\n   - Each action should logically follow from the previous one\n   - If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.\n   - If content only disappears the sequence continues.\n   - Only provide the action sequence until you think the page will change.\n   - Try to be efficient, e.g. fill forms at once, or chain actions where nothing changes on the page like saving, extracting, checkboxes...\n   - NEVER use multiple actions in a single step (otherwise ONLY the first action will be executed)\n\n9. Long tasks:\n- If the task is long keep track of the status in the memory. If the ultimate task requires multiple subinformation, keep track of the status in the memory\n\nFunctions:\n\n* \"click\" : Click on an element of the current page.

Respond with valid JSON containing your action sequence and state assessment\n\nCurrent date and time: 2025-03-26 16:48:26\n\nINPUT STRUCTURE:\n1. Current URL: The webpage you're currently on\n2. Available Tabs: List of open browser tabs\n3. Interactive Elements: List in the format:\n   id[:]<element_type>element_text</element_type>\n   - `id`: identifier for interaction. `ids` can be decomposed into `<role_first_letter><index>[:]` where `<index>` is the index of the element in the list of elements with the same role and `<role_first_letter>` are:\n        - `I` for input fields (textbox, select, checkbox, etc.)\n        - `B` for buttons\n        - `L` for links\n        - `F` for figures and images\n        - `O` for options in select elements\n        - `M` for miscallaneous elements (e.g. modals, dialogs, etc.) that are only clickable for the most part.\n   - `element_type`: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)\n   - `element_text`: Visible text or element description\n\nExample:\nB1[:]<button>Submit Form</button>\n_[:] Non-interactive text\n\n\nNotes:\n- Only elements with `ids` are interactive\n- `_[:]` elements provide context but cannot be interacted with\n\n1. RESPONSE FORMAT: You must ALWAYS respond with valid JSON in this exact format:\n```json\n\n{\n  \"state\": {\n    \"page_summary\": \"On the page are company a,b,c wtih their revenue 1,2,3.\",\n    \"relevant_interactions\": [{\"id\": \"B2\", \"reason\": \"The button with id B2 represents search and I'm looking to search\"}],\n    \"previous_goal_status\": \"success|failure|unknown\",\n    \"previous_goal_eval\": \"Analyze the current elements and the image to check if the previous goals/actions are successful like intended by the task. Ignore the action result. The website is the ground truth. Also mention if something unexpected happened like new suggestions in an input field.

ACTIONS: You are only allowed to chose one single action from the list to be executed.\n\nYou will find below some common actions sequences so that you can undertand the flow of some tasks.\nIDS presented in those sequences correspond to interactionable elements found in the page.\nYou might encounter the same ids, but never assume them to exist, or have the same role.\n\n   Common action sequences:\n   - Form filling:\n```json\n[\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I99\", \"value\": \"username\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I101\", \"value\": \"password\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"click\": {\"id\": \"B1\"}}\n]\n```\n   - Navigation and extraction:\n```json\n[\n  {\"goto\": {\"url\": \"https://www.google.com\"}},\n  {\"scrape\": {\"instructions\": null}}\n]\n```\n\nREMEMBER: You are NEVER allowed to specify multiple actions in the list of actions.\n\n\n3. ELEMENT INTERACTION:\n   - Only use `ids` that exist in the provided element list\n   - Each element has a unique `id` (e.g., `I2[:]<button>`)\n   - Elements marked with `_[:]` are non-interactive (for context only)\n\n4. NAVIGATION & ERROR HANDLING:\n   - If no suitable elements exist, use other functions to complete the task\n   - If stuck, try alternative approaches\n   - Handle popups/cookies by accepting or closing them\n   - Use scroll to find elements you are looking for\n\n5. TASK COMPLETION:\n   - Use the `completion` action as the last action as soon as the task is complete\n   - Don't hallucinate actions\n   - If the task requires specific information - make sure to include everything in the `completion` function. This is what the user will see.\n   - If you are running out of steps (current step), think about speeding it up, and ALWAYS use the `completion` action as the last action.\n   - Note that the `completion` can fail because an external validator failed to validate the output. If this happens, you should reflect on why the output is invalid and try to fix it.\n\n   - Example of sucessfuly `completion` action:\n```json\n[\n  {\"completion\": {\"success\": true, \"answer\": \"<answer to the task>\"}}\n]\n```\n\n6. VISUAL CONTEXT:\n   - When an image is provided, use it to understand the page layout\n   - Bounding boxes with labels correspond to element indexes\n   - Each bounding box and its label have the same color\n   - Most often the label is inside the bounding box, on the top right\n   - Visual context helps verify element locations and relationships\n   - sometimes labels overlap, so use the context to verify the correct element\n\n7. Form filling:\n   - If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often a list with suggestions popped up under the field and you need to first select the right element from the suggestion list.\n\n8. ACTION SEQUENCING:\n   - Actions are executed in the order they appear in the list\n   - Each action should logically follow from the previous one\n   - If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.\n   - If content only disappears the sequence continues.\n   - Only provide the action sequence until you think the page will change.\n   - Try to be efficient, e.g. fill forms at once, or chain actions where nothing changes on the page like saving, extracting, checkboxes...\n   - NEVER use multiple actions in a single step (otherwise ONLY the first action will be executed)\n\n9. Long tasks:\n- If the task is long keep track of the status in the memory. If the ultimate task requires multiple subinformation, keep track of the status in the memory\n\nFunctions:\n\n* \"click\" : Click on an element of the current page.

Current models, such as CNN and Transformer-based architectures, excel at identifying pixel-level features but fail to distinguish semantically similar objects (e.g., \"doctor\" vs. \"nurse\" in a hospital scene) or understand complex contextual scenarios (e.g., differentiating a running child from a regular pedestrian in autonomous driving). To address these limitations, we proposed a novel Context-Aware Semantic Segmentation framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with state-of-the-art vision backbones. Our hybrid model leverages the Swin Transformer for robust visual feature extraction and GPT-4 for enriching semantic understanding through text embeddings. A Cross-Attention Mechanism is introduced to align vision and language features, enabling the model to reason about context more effectively. Additionally, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are employed to model object relationships within the scene, capturing dependencies that are overlooked by traditional models. Experimental results on benchmark datasets (e.g., COCO, Cityscapes) demonstrate that our approach outperforms the existing methods in both pixel-level accuracy (mIoU) and contextual understanding (mAP). This work bridges the gap between vision and language, paving the path for more intelligent and context-aware vision systems in applications including autonomous driving, medical imaging, and robotics.\n_[:]Subjects:\n_[:]Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)\n_[:]; Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)\n_[:]Cite as:\nL9[:]<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19276\">arXiv:2503.19276</a>\n_[:][cs.CV]\n_[:](or\nL10[:]<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19276v1\">arXiv:2503.19276v1</a>\n_[:][cs.CV]\n_[:]for this version)\nL11[:]<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2503.19276\">https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2503.19276</a>\nB2[:]<button>Focus to learn more</button>\n_[:]Submission history\n_[:]From: Ben Rahman Dr. [\nL12[:]<a href=\"/show-email/32e0ab95/2503.19276\">view email</a>\n_[:]]\n_[:][v1]\n_[:]Tue, 25 Mar 2025 02:12:35 UTC (1,557 KB)\n_[:]Access Paper:\nL13[:]<a href=\"/pdf/2503.19276\">View PDF</a>\nL14[:]<a href=\"/format/2503.19276\">Other Formats</a>\nL15[:]<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/\" title=\"Rights to this article\">view license</a>\n_[:]Current browse context:\n_[:]cs.CV\nL16[:]<a href=\"/prevnext?id=2503.19276&function=prev&context=cs.CV\" title=\"previous in cs.CV (accesskey p)\"><\u00a0prev</a>\n_[:]|\nL17[:]<a href=\"/prevnext?id=2503.19276&function=next&context=cs.CV\" title=\"next in cs.CV (accesskey n)\">next\u00a0></a>\nL18[:]<a href=\"/list/cs.CV/new\">new</a>\n_[:]|\nL19[:]<a href=\"/list/cs.CV/recent\">recent</a>\n_[:]|\nL20[:]<a href=\"/list/cs.CV/2025-03\">2025-03</a>\n_[:]Change to browse by:\nL21[:]<a href=\"/abs/2503.19276?context=cs\">cs</a>\nL22[:]<a href=\"/abs/2503.19276?context=cs.AI\">cs.AI</a>\n_[:]References & Citations\nL23[:]<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/arXiv:2503.19276\">NASA ADS</a>\nL24[:]<a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?arxiv_id=2503.1927...\">Google Scholar</a>\nL25[:]<a href=\"https://api.semanticscholar.org/arXiv:2503.19276\">Semantic Scholar</a>\n_[:]export BibTeX citation\n_[:]Bookmark\nL26[:]<a href=\"http://www.bibsonomy.org/BibtexHandler?requTask=upload&url=h...\" title=\"Bookmark on BibSonomy\"></a>\nF3[:]<img src=\"/static/browse/0.3.4/images/icons/social/bibsonomy.png\" alt=\"BibSonomy logo\"></img>\nL27[:]<a href=\"https://reddit.com/submit?url=https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.192...\" title=\"Bookmark on Reddit\"></a>\nF4[:]<img src=\"/static/browse/0.3.4/images/icons/social/reddit.png\" alt=\"Reddit logo\"></img>\nM1[:]<label>Bibliographic Tools</label>\n_[:]Bibliographic and Citation Tools\nM2[:]<label>Bibliographic Explorer Toggle</label>\n_[:]Bibliographic Explorer\n_[:](\nL28[:]<a href=\"https://info.arxiv.org/labs/showcase.html#arxiv-bibliographi...\">What is the Explorer?</a>\n_[:])\nM3[:]<label>Connected Papers Toggle</label>\n_[:]Connected Papers\n_[:](\nL29[:]<a href=\"https://www.connectedpapers.com/about\">What is Connected Papers?</a>\n_[:])\nM4[:]<label>Litmaps Toggle</label>\n_[:]Litmaps\n_[:](\nL30[:]<a href=\"https://www.litmaps.co/\">What is Litmaps?</a>\n_[:])\nM5[:]<label>scite.ai Toggle</label>\n_[:]scite Smart Citations\n_[:](\nL31[:]<a href=\"https://www.scite.ai/\">What are Smart Citations?</a>\n_[:])\nM6[:]<label>Code, Data, Media</label>\nM7[:]<label>Demos</label>\nM8[:]<label>Related Papers</label>\nM9[:]<label>About arXivLabs</label>\n... 361 pixels below - scroll or scrape content to see more ...\n[End of page]\n\n\n\n[Data found in the page]\n\n"

ACTIONS: You are only allowed to chose one single action from the list to be executed.\n\nYou will find below some common actions sequences so that you can undertand the flow of some tasks.\nIDS presented in those sequences correspond to interactionable elements found in the page.\nYou might encounter the same ids, but never assume them to exist, or have the same role.\n\n   Common action sequences:\n   - Form filling:\n```json\n[\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I99\", \"value\": \"username\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I101\", \"value\": \"password\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"click\": {\"id\": \"B1\"}}\n]\n```\n   - Navigation and extraction:\n```json\n[\n  {\"goto\": {\"url\": \"https://www.google.com\"}},\n  {\"scrape\": {\"instructions\": null}}\n]\n```\n\nREMEMBER: You are NEVER allowed to specify multiple actions in the list of actions.\n\n\n3. ELEMENT INTERACTION:\n   - Only use `ids` that exist in the provided element list\n   - Each element has a unique `id` (e.g., `I2[:]<button>`)\n   - Elements marked with `_[:]` are non-interactive (for context only)\n\n4. NAVIGATION & ERROR HANDLING:\n   - If no suitable elements exist, use other functions to complete the task\n   - If stuck, try alternative approaches\n   - Handle popups/cookies by accepting or closing them\n   - Use scroll to find elements you are looking for\n\n5. TASK COMPLETION:\n   - Use the `completion` action as the last action as soon as the task is complete\n   - Don't hallucinate actions\n   - If the task requires specific information - make sure to include everything in the `completion` function. This is what the user will see.\n   - If you are running out of steps (current step), think about speeding it up, and ALWAYS use the `completion` action as the last action.\n   - Note that the `completion` can fail because an external validator failed to validate the output. If this happens, you should reflect on why the output is invalid and try to fix it.\n\n   - Example of sucessfuly `completion` action:\n```json\n[\n  {\"completion\": {\"success\": true, \"answer\": \"<answer to the task>\"}}\n]\n```\n\n6. VISUAL CONTEXT:\n   - When an image is provided, use it to understand the page layout\n   - Bounding boxes with labels correspond to element indexes\n   - Each bounding box and its label have the same color\n   - Most often the label is inside the bounding box, on the top right\n   - Visual context helps verify element locations and relationships\n   - sometimes labels overlap, so use the context to verify the correct element\n\n7. Form filling:\n   - If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often a list with suggestions popped up under the field and you need to first select the right element from the suggestion list.\n\n8. ACTION SEQUENCING:\n   - Actions are executed in the order they appear in the list\n   - Each action should logically follow from the previous one\n   - If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.\n   - If content only disappears the sequence continues.\n   - Only provide the action sequence until you think the page will change.\n   - Try to be efficient, e.g. fill forms at once, or chain actions where nothing changes on the page like saving, extracting, checkboxes...\n   - NEVER use multiple actions in a single step (otherwise ONLY the first action will be executed)\n\n9. Long tasks:\n- If the task is long keep track of the status in the memory. If the ultimate task requires multiple subinformation, keep track of the status in the memory\n\nFunctions:\n\n* \"click\" : Click on an element of the current page.

Respond with valid JSON containing your action sequence and state assessment\n\nCurrent date and time: 2025-03-26 16:48:36\n\nINPUT STRUCTURE:\n1. Current URL: The webpage you're currently on\n2. Available Tabs: List of open browser tabs\n3. Interactive Elements: List in the format:\n   id[:]<element_type>element_text</element_type>\n   - `id`: identifier for interaction. `ids` can be decomposed into `<role_first_letter><index>[:]` where `<index>` is the index of the element in the list of elements with the same role and `<role_first_letter>` are:\n        - `I` for input fields (textbox, select, checkbox, etc.)\n        - `B` for buttons\n        - `L` for links\n        - `F` for figures and images\n        - `O` for options in select elements\n        - `M` for miscallaneous elements (e.g. modals, dialogs, etc.) that are only clickable for the most part.\n   - `element_type`: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)\n   - `element_text`: Visible text or element description\n\nExample:\nB1[:]<button>Submit Form</button>\n_[:] Non-interactive text\n\n\nNotes:\n- Only elements with `ids` are interactive\n- `_[:]` elements provide context but cannot be interacted with\n\n1. RESPONSE FORMAT: You must ALWAYS respond with valid JSON in this exact format:\n```json\n\n{\n  \"state\": {\n    \"page_summary\": \"On the page are company a,b,c wtih their revenue 1,2,3.\",\n    \"relevant_interactions\": [{\"id\": \"B2\", \"reason\": \"The button with id B2 represents search and I'm looking to search\"}],\n    \"previous_goal_status\": \"success|failure|unknown\",\n    \"previous_goal_eval\": \"Analyze the current elements and the image to check if the previous goals/actions are successful like intended by the task.

ACTIONS: You are only allowed to chose one single action from the list to be executed.\n\nYou will find below some common actions sequences so that you can undertand the flow of some tasks.\nIDS presented in those sequences correspond to interactionable elements found in the page.\nYou might encounter the same ids, but never assume them to exist, or have the same role.\n\n   Common action sequences:\n   - Form filling:\n```json\n[\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I99\", \"value\": \"username\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I101\", \"value\": \"password\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"click\": {\"id\": \"B1\"}}\n]\n```\n   - Navigation and extraction:\n```json\n[\n  {\"goto\": {\"url\": \"https://www.google.com\"}},\n  {\"scrape\": {\"instructions\": null}}\n]\n```\n\nREMEMBER: You are NEVER allowed to specify multiple actions in the list of actions.\n\n\n3. ELEMENT INTERACTION:\n   - Only use `ids` that exist in the provided element list\n   - Each element has a unique `id` (e.g., `I2[:]<button>`)\n   - Elements marked with `_[:]` are non-interactive (for context only)\n\n4. NAVIGATION & ERROR HANDLING:\n   - If no suitable elements exist, use other functions to complete the task\n   - If stuck, try alternative approaches\n   - Handle popups/cookies by accepting or closing them\n   - Use scroll to find elements you are looking for\n\n5. TASK COMPLETION:\n   - Use the `completion` action as the last action as soon as the task is complete\n   - Don't hallucinate actions\n   - If the task requires specific information - make sure to include everything in the `completion` function. This is what the user will see.\n   - If you are running out of steps (current step), think about speeding it up, and ALWAYS use the `completion` action as the last action.\n   - Note that the `completion` can fail because an external validator failed to validate the output. If this happens, you should reflect on why the output is invalid and try to fix it.\n\n   - Example of sucessfuly `completion` action:\n```json\n[\n  {\"completion\": {\"success\": true, \"answer\": \"<answer to the task>\"}}\n]\n```\n\n6. VISUAL CONTEXT:\n   - When an image is provided, use it to understand the page layout\n   - Bounding boxes with labels correspond to element indexes\n   - Each bounding box and its label have the same color\n   - Most often the label is inside the bounding box, on the top right\n   - Visual context helps verify element locations and relationships\n   - sometimes labels overlap, so use the context to verify the correct element\n\n7. Form filling:\n   - If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often a list with suggestions popped up under the field and you need to first select the right element from the suggestion list.\n\n8. ACTION SEQUENCING:\n   - Actions are executed in the order they appear in the list\n   - Each action should logically follow from the previous one\n   - If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.\n   - If content only disappears the sequence continues.\n   - Only provide the action sequence until you think the page will change.\n   - Try to be efficient, e.g. fill forms at once, or chain actions where nothing changes on the page like saving, extracting, checkboxes...\n   - NEVER use multiple actions in a single step (otherwise ONLY the first action will be executed)\n\n9. Long tasks:\n- If the task is long keep track of the status in the memory. If the ultimate task requires multiple subinformation, keep track of the status in the memory\n\nFunctions:\n\n* \"click\" : Click on an element of the current page.

However, there are few studies on 3D indoor scene generation with VLMs. This paper considers this task as a planning problem subject to spatial and layout common sense constraints. To solve the problem with a VLM, we propose a new global-local tree search algorithm. Globally, the method places each object sequentially and explores multiple placements during each placement process, where the problem space is represented as a tree. To reduce the depth of the tree, we decompose the scene structure hierarchically, i.e. room level, region level, floor object level, and supported object level. The algorithm independently generates the floor objects in different regions and supported objects placed on different floor objects. Locally, we also decompose the sub-task, the placement of each object, into multiple steps. The algorithm searches the tree of problem space. To leverage the VLM model to produce positions of objects, we discretize the top-down view space as a dense grid and fill each cell with diverse emojis to make to cells distinct. We prompt the VLM with the emoji grid and the VLM produces a reasonable location for the object by describing the position with the name of emojis. The quantitative and qualitative experimental results illustrate our approach generates more plausible 3D scenes than state-of-the-art approaches.
