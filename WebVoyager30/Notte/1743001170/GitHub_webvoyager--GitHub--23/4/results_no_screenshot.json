Respond with valid JSON containing your action sequence and state assessment\n\nCurrent date and time: 2025-03-26 18:03:32\n\nINPUT STRUCTURE:\n1. Current URL: The webpage you're currently on\n2. Available Tabs: List of open browser tabs\n3. Interactive Elements: List in the format:\n   id[:]<element_type>element_text</element_type>\n   - `id`: identifier for interaction. `ids` can be decomposed into `<role_first_letter><index>[:]` where `<index>` is the index of the element in the list of elements with the same role and `<role_first_letter>` are:\n        - `I` for input fields (textbox, select, checkbox, etc.)\n        - `B` for buttons\n        - `L` for links\n        - `F` for figures and images\n        - `O` for options in select elements\n        - `M` for miscallaneous elements (e.g. modals, dialogs, etc.) that are only clickable for the most part.\n   - `element_type`: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)\n   - `element_text`: Visible text or element description\n\nExample:\nB1[:]<button>Submit Form</button>\n_[:] Non-interactive text\n\n\nNotes:\n- Only elements with `ids` are interactive\n- `_[:]` elements provide context but cannot be interacted with\n\n1. RESPONSE FORMAT: You must ALWAYS respond with valid JSON in this exact format:\n```json\n\n{\n  \"state\": {\n    \"page_summary\": \"On the page are company a,b,c wtih their revenue 1,2,3.\",\n    \"relevant_interactions\": [{\"id\": \"B2\", \"reason\": \"The button with id B2 represents search and I'm looking to search\"}],\n    \"previous_goal_status\": \"success|failure|unknown\",\n    \"previous_goal_eval\": \"Analyze the current elements and the image to check if the previous goals/actions are successful like intended by the task.

ACTIONS: You are only allowed to chose one single action from the list to be executed.\n\nYou will find below some common actions sequences so that you can undertand the flow of some tasks.\nIDS presented in those sequences correspond to interactionable elements found in the page.\nYou might encounter the same ids, but never assume them to exist, or have the same role.\n\n   Common action sequences:\n   - Form filling:\n```json\n[\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I99\", \"value\": \"username\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I101\", \"value\": \"password\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"click\": {\"id\": \"B1\"}}\n]\n```\n   - Navigation and extraction:\n```json\n[\n  {\"goto\": {\"url\": \"https://www.google.com\"}},\n  {\"scrape\": {\"instructions\": null}}\n]\n```\n\nREMEMBER: You are NEVER allowed to specify multiple actions in the list of actions.\n\n\n3. ELEMENT INTERACTION:\n   - Only use `ids` that exist in the provided element list\n   - Each element has a unique `id` (e.g., `I2[:]<button>`)\n   - Elements marked with `_[:]` are non-interactive (for context only)\n\n4. NAVIGATION & ERROR HANDLING:\n   - If no suitable elements exist, use other functions to complete the task\n   - If stuck, try alternative approaches\n   - Handle popups/cookies by accepting or closing them\n   - Use scroll to find elements you are looking for\n\n5. TASK COMPLETION:\n   - Use the `completion` action as the last action as soon as the task is complete\n   - Don't hallucinate actions\n   - If the task requires specific information - make sure to include everything in the `completion` function. This is what the user will see.\n   - If you are running out of steps (current step), think about speeding it up, and ALWAYS use the `completion` action as the last action.\n   - Note that the `completion` can fail because an external validator failed to validate the output. If this happens, you should reflect on why the output is invalid and try to fix it.\n\n   - Example of sucessfuly `completion` action:\n```json\n[\n  {\"completion\": {\"success\": true, \"answer\": \"<answer to the task>\"}}\n]\n```\n\n6. VISUAL CONTEXT:\n   - When an image is provided, use it to understand the page layout\n   - Bounding boxes with labels correspond to element indexes\n   - Each bounding box and its label have the same color\n   - Most often the label is inside the bounding box, on the top right\n   - Visual context helps verify element locations and relationships\n   - sometimes labels overlap, so use the context to verify the correct element\n\n7. Form filling:\n   - If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often a list with suggestions popped up under the field and you need to first select the right element from the suggestion list.\n\n8. ACTION SEQUENCING:\n   - Actions are executed in the order they appear in the list\n   - Each action should logically follow from the previous one\n   - If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.\n   - If content only disappears the sequence continues.\n   - Only provide the action sequence until you think the page will change.\n   - Try to be efficient, e.g. fill forms at once, or chain actions where nothing changes on the page like saving, extracting, checkboxes...\n   - NEVER use multiple actions in a single step (otherwise ONLY the first action will be executed)\n\n9. Long tasks:\n- If the task is long keep track of the status in the memory. If the ultimate task requires multiple subinformation, keep track of the status in the memory\n\nFunctions:\n\n* \"go_forward\" : Go forward to the next page (in current tab). Format:\n```json\n{\"go_forward\": {}}\n```\n\n* \"switch_tab\" : Switch to a tab (identified by its index).

Use `True` to check, `False` to uncheck. Format:\n```json\n{\"check\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"value\": {\"type\": \"boolean\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"press_key\" : Press a keyboard key: e.g. 'Enter', 'Backspace', 'Insert', 'Delete', etc.. Format:\n```json\n{\"press_key\": {\"key\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"scroll_down\" : Scroll down by a given amount of pixels. Use `null` for scrolling down one page.

Format:\n```json\n{\"select_dropdown_option\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"option_id\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}, \"value\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"reload\" : Reload the current page. Format:\n```json\n{\"reload\": {}}\n```\n\n* \"scrape\" : Scrape the current page data in text format. If `instructions` is null then the whole page will be scraped. Otherwise, only the data that matches the instructions will be scraped. Instructions should be given as natural language, e.g. 'Extract the title and the price of the product'. Format:\n```json\n{\"scrape\": {\"instructions\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"click\" : Click on an element of the current page.

Respond with valid JSON containing your action sequence and state assessment\n\nCurrent date and time: 2025-03-26 18:03:40\n\nINPUT STRUCTURE:\n1. Current URL: The webpage you're currently on\n2. Available Tabs: List of open browser tabs\n3. Interactive Elements: List in the format:\n   id[:]<element_type>element_text</element_type>\n   - `id`: identifier for interaction. `ids` can be decomposed into `<role_first_letter><index>[:]` where `<index>` is the index of the element in the list of elements with the same role and `<role_first_letter>` are:\n        - `I` for input fields (textbox, select, checkbox, etc.)\n        - `B` for buttons\n        - `L` for links\n        - `F` for figures and images\n        - `O` for options in select elements\n        - `M` for miscallaneous elements (e.g. modals, dialogs, etc.) that are only clickable for the most part.\n   - `element_type`: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)\n   - `element_text`: Visible text or element description\n\nExample:\nB1[:]<button>Submit Form</button>\n_[:] Non-interactive text\n\n\nNotes:\n- Only elements with `ids` are interactive\n- `_[:]` elements provide context but cannot be interacted with\n\n1. RESPONSE FORMAT: You must ALWAYS respond with valid JSON in this exact format:\n```json\n\n{\n  \"state\": {\n    \"page_summary\": \"On the page are company a,b,c wtih their revenue 1,2,3.\",\n    \"relevant_interactions\": [{\"id\": \"B2\", \"reason\": \"The button with id B2 represents search and I'm looking to search\"}],\n    \"previous_goal_status\": \"success|failure|unknown\",\n    \"previous_goal_eval\": \"Analyze the current elements and the image to check if the previous goals/actions are successful like intended by the task. Ignore the action result. The website is the ground truth. Also mention if something unexpected happened like new suggestions in an input field. Shortly state why/why not\",\n    \"memory\": \"Description of what has been done and what you need to remember until the end of the task\",\n    \"next_goal\": \"What needs to be done with the next actions\"\n  },\n  \"actions\": [\n   { \"one_action_name\": {\n      // action-specific parameter\n      ...\n   }\n   }, // ... more actions in sequence ...\n  ]\n}\n\n```\n\n\n2. ACTIONS: You are only allowed to chose one single action from the list to be executed.\n\nYou will find below some common actions sequences so that you can undertand the flow of some tasks.\nIDS presented in those sequences correspond to interactionable elements found in the page.\nYou might encounter the same ids, but never assume them to exist, or have the same role.\n\n   Common action sequences:\n   - Form filling:\n```json\n[\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I99\", \"value\": \"username\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I101\", \"value\": \"password\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"click\": {\"id\": \"B1\"}}\n]\n```\n   - Navigation and extraction:\n```json\n[\n  {\"goto\": {\"url\": \"https://www.google.com\"}},\n  {\"scrape\": {\"instructions\": null}}\n]\n```\n\nREMEMBER: You are NEVER allowed to specify multiple actions in the list of actions.\n\n\n3. ELEMENT INTERACTION:\n   - Only use `ids` that exist in the provided element list\n   - Each element has a unique `id` (e.g., `I2[:]<button>`)\n   - Elements marked with `_[:]` are non-interactive (for context only)\n\n4. NAVIGATION & ERROR HANDLING:\n   - If no suitable elements exist, use other functions to complete the task\n   - If stuck, try alternative approaches\n   - Handle popups/cookies by accepting or closing them\n   - Use scroll to find elements you are looking for\n\n5. TASK COMPLETION:\n   - Use the `completion` action as the last action as soon as the task is complete\n   - Don't hallucinate actions\n   - If the task requires specific information - make sure to include everything in the `completion` function. This is what the user will see.\n   - If you are running out of steps (current step), think about speeding it up, and ALWAYS use the `completion` action as the last action.\n   - Note that the `completion` can fail because an external validator failed to validate the output. If this happens, you should reflect on why the output is invalid and try to fix it.\n\n   - Example of sucessfuly `completion` action:\n```json\n[\n  {\"completion\": {\"success\": true, \"answer\": \"<answer to the task>\"}}\n]\n```\n\n6. VISUAL CONTEXT:\n   - When an image is provided, use it to understand the page layout\n   - Bounding boxes with labels correspond to element indexes\n   - Each bounding box and its label have the same color\n   - Most often the label is inside the bounding box, on the top right\n   - Visual context helps verify element locations and relationships\n   - sometimes labels overlap, so use the context to verify the correct element\n\n7. Form filling:\n   - If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often a list with suggestions popped up under the field and you need to first select the right element from the suggestion list.\n\n8. ACTION SEQUENCING:\n   - Actions are executed in the order they appear in the list\n   - Each action should logically follow from the previous one\n   - If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.\n   - If content only disappears the sequence continues.\n   - Only provide the action sequence until you think the page will change.\n   - Try to be efficient, e.g. fill forms at once, or chain actions where nothing changes on the page like saving, extracting, checkboxes...\n   - NEVER use multiple actions in a single step (otherwise ONLY the first action will be executed)\n\n9. Long tasks:\n- If the task is long keep track of the status in the memory. If the ultimate task requires multiple subinformation, keep track of the status in the memory\n\nFunctions:\n\n* \"go_forward\" : Go forward to the next page (in current tab). Format:\n```json\n{\"go_forward\": {}}\n```\n\n* \"switch_tab\" : Switch to a tab (identified by its index). Format:\n```json\n{\"switch_tab\": {\"tab_index\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"go_back\" : Go back to the previous page (in current tab). Format:\n```json\n{\"go_back\": {}}\n```\n\n* \"completion\" : Complete the task by returning the answer and terminate the browser session. Format:\n```json\n{\"completion\": {\"success\": {\"type\": \"boolean\"}, \"answer\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"goto\" : Goto to a URL (in current tab). Format:\n```json\n{\"goto\": {\"url\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"fill\" : Fill an input field with a value. Format:\n```json\n{\"fill\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"value\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"clear_before_fill\": {\"default\": true, \"type\": \"boolean\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"scroll_up\" : Scroll up by a given amount of pixels. Use `null` for scrolling up one page. Format:\n```json\n{\"scroll_up\": {\"amount\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"integer\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"check\" : Check a checkbox. Use `True` to check, `False` to uncheck. Format:\n```json\n{\"check\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"value\": {\"type\": \"boolean\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"press_key\" : Press a keyboard key: e.g. 'Enter', 'Backspace', 'Insert', 'Delete', etc.. Format:\n```json\n{\"press_key\": {\"key\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"scroll_down\" : Scroll down by a given amount of pixels. Use `null` for scrolling down one page. Format:\n```json\n{\"scroll_down\": {\"amount\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"integer\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"wait\" : Wait for a given amount of time (in milliseconds). Format:\n```json\n{\"wait\": {\"time_ms\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"select_dropdown_option\" : Select an option from a dropdown. The `id` field should be set to the select element's id. Then you can either set the `value` field to the option's text or the `option_id` field to the option's `id`.. Format:\n```json\n{\"select_dropdown_option\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"option_id\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}, \"value\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"reload\" : Reload the current page. Format:\n```json\n{\"reload\": {}}\n```\n\n* \"scrape\" : Scrape the current page data in text format. If `instructions` is null then the whole page will be scraped. Otherwise, only the data that matches the instructions will be scraped. Instructions should be given as natural language, e.g. 'Extract the title and the price of the product'. Format:\n```json\n{\"scrape\": {\"instructions\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"click\" : Click on an element of the current page. Format:\n```json\n{\"click\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"goto_new_tab\" : Goto to a URL (in new tab). Format:\n```json\n{\"goto_new_tab\": {\"url\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"list_dropdown_options\" : List all options of a dropdown. Format:\n```json\n{\"list_dropdown_options\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n\nRemember: Your responses must be valid JSON matching the specified format. Each action in the sequence must be valid.\n"

Interactive Elements: List in the format:\n   id[:]<element_type>element_text</element_type>\n   - `id`: identifier for interaction. `ids` can be decomposed into `<role_first_letter><index>[:]` where `<index>` is the index of the element in the list of elements with the same role and `<role_first_letter>` are:\n        - `I` for input fields (textbox, select, checkbox, etc.)\n        - `B` for buttons\n        - `L` for links\n        - `F` for figures and images\n        - `O` for options in select elements\n        - `M` for miscallaneous elements (e.g. modals, dialogs, etc.) that are only clickable for the most part.\n   - `element_type`: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)\n   - `element_text`: Visible text or element description\n\nExample:\nB1[:]<button>Submit Form</button>\n_[:] Non-interactive text\n\n\nNotes:\n- Only elements with `ids` are interactive\n- `_[:]` elements provide context but cannot be interacted with\n\n1. RESPONSE FORMAT: You must ALWAYS respond with valid JSON in this exact format:\n```json\n\n{\n  \"state\": {\n    \"page_summary\": \"On the page are company a,b,c wtih their revenue 1,2,3.\",\n    \"relevant_interactions\": [{\"id\": \"B2\", \"reason\": \"The button with id B2 represents search and I'm looking to search\"}],\n    \"previous_goal_status\": \"success|failure|unknown\",\n    \"previous_goal_eval\": \"Analyze the current elements and the image to check if the previous goals/actions are successful like intended by the task.

ACTIONS: You are only allowed to chose one single action from the list to be executed.\n\nYou will find below some common actions sequences so that you can undertand the flow of some tasks.\nIDS presented in those sequences correspond to interactionable elements found in the page.\nYou might encounter the same ids, but never assume them to exist, or have the same role.\n\n   Common action sequences:\n   - Form filling:\n```json\n[\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I99\", \"value\": \"username\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I101\", \"value\": \"password\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"click\": {\"id\": \"B1\"}}\n]\n```\n   - Navigation and extraction:\n```json\n[\n  {\"goto\": {\"url\": \"https://www.google.com\"}},\n  {\"scrape\": {\"instructions\": null}}\n]\n```\n\nREMEMBER: You are NEVER allowed to specify multiple actions in the list of actions.\n\n\n3. ELEMENT INTERACTION:\n   - Only use `ids` that exist in the provided element list\n   - Each element has a unique `id` (e.g., `I2[:]<button>`)\n   - Elements marked with `_[:]` are non-interactive (for context only)\n\n4. NAVIGATION & ERROR HANDLING:\n   - If no suitable elements exist, use other functions to complete the task\n   - If stuck, try alternative approaches\n   - Handle popups/cookies by accepting or closing them\n   - Use scroll to find elements you are looking for\n\n5. TASK COMPLETION:\n   - Use the `completion` action as the last action as soon as the task is complete\n   - Don't hallucinate actions\n   - If the task requires specific information - make sure to include everything in the `completion` function. This is what the user will see.\n   - If you are running out of steps (current step), think about speeding it up, and ALWAYS use the `completion` action as the last action.\n   - Note that the `completion` can fail because an external validator failed to validate the output. If this happens, you should reflect on why the output is invalid and try to fix it.\n\n   - Example of sucessfuly `completion` action:\n```json\n[\n  {\"completion\": {\"success\": true, \"answer\": \"<answer to the task>\"}}\n]\n```\n\n6. VISUAL CONTEXT:\n   - When an image is provided, use it to understand the page layout\n   - Bounding boxes with labels correspond to element indexes\n   - Each bounding box and its label have the same color\n   - Most often the label is inside the bounding box, on the top right\n   - Visual context helps verify element locations and relationships\n   - sometimes labels overlap, so use the context to verify the correct element\n\n7. Form filling:\n   - If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often a list with suggestions popped up under the field and you need to first select the right element from the suggestion list.\n\n8. ACTION SEQUENCING:\n   - Actions are executed in the order they appear in the list\n   - Each action should logically follow from the previous one\n   - If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.\n   - If content only disappears the sequence continues.\n   - Only provide the action sequence until you think the page will change.\n   - Try to be efficient, e.g. fill forms at once, or chain actions where nothing changes on the page like saving, extracting, checkboxes...\n   - NEVER use multiple actions in a single step (otherwise ONLY the first action will be executed)\n\n9. Long tasks:\n- If the task is long keep track of the status in the memory. If the ultimate task requires multiple subinformation, keep track of the status in the memory\n\nFunctions:\n\n* \"go_forward\" : Go forward to the next page (in current tab).

Respond with valid JSON containing your action sequence and state assessment\n\nCurrent date and time: 2025-03-26 18:03:52\n\nINPUT STRUCTURE:\n1. Current URL: The webpage you're currently on\n2. Available Tabs: List of open browser tabs\n3. Interactive Elements: List in the format:\n   id[:]<element_type>element_text</element_type>\n   - `id`: identifier for interaction. `ids` can be decomposed into `<role_first_letter><index>[:]` where `<index>` is the index of the element in the list of elements with the same role and `<role_first_letter>` are:\n        - `I` for input fields (textbox, select, checkbox, etc.)\n        - `B` for buttons\n        - `L` for links\n        - `F` for figures and images\n        - `O` for options in select elements\n        - `M` for miscallaneous elements (e.g. modals, dialogs, etc.) that are only clickable for the most part.\n   - `element_type`: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)\n   - `element_text`: Visible text or element description\n\nExample:\nB1[:]<button>Submit Form</button>\n_[:] Non-interactive text\n\n\nNotes:\n- Only elements with `ids` are interactive\n- `_[:]` elements provide context but cannot be interacted with\n\n1. RESPONSE FORMAT: You must ALWAYS respond with valid JSON in this exact format:\n```json\n\n{\n  \"state\": {\n    \"page_summary\": \"On the page are company a,b,c wtih their revenue 1,2,3.\",\n    \"relevant_interactions\": [{\"id\": \"B2\", \"reason\": \"The button with id B2 represents search and I'm looking to search\"}],\n    \"previous_goal_status\": \"success|failure|unknown\",\n    \"previous_goal_eval\": \"Analyze the current elements and the image to check if the previous goals/actions are successful like intended by the task.

ACTIONS: You are only allowed to chose one single action from the list to be executed.\n\nYou will find below some common actions sequences so that you can undertand the flow of some tasks.\nIDS presented in those sequences correspond to interactionable elements found in the page.\nYou might encounter the same ids, but never assume them to exist, or have the same role.\n\n   Common action sequences:\n   - Form filling:\n```json\n[\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I99\", \"value\": \"username\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I101\", \"value\": \"password\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"click\": {\"id\": \"B1\"}}\n]\n```\n   - Navigation and extraction:\n```json\n[\n  {\"goto\": {\"url\": \"https://www.google.com\"}},\n  {\"scrape\": {\"instructions\": null}}\n]\n```\n\nREMEMBER: You are NEVER allowed to specify multiple actions in the list of actions.\n\n\n3. ELEMENT INTERACTION:\n   - Only use `ids` that exist in the provided element list\n   - Each element has a unique `id` (e.g., `I2[:]<button>`)\n   - Elements marked with `_[:]` are non-interactive (for context only)\n\n4. NAVIGATION & ERROR HANDLING:\n   - If no suitable elements exist, use other functions to complete the task\n   - If stuck, try alternative approaches\n   - Handle popups/cookies by accepting or closing them\n   - Use scroll to find elements you are looking for\n\n5. TASK COMPLETION:\n   - Use the `completion` action as the last action as soon as the task is complete\n   - Don't hallucinate actions\n   - If the task requires specific information - make sure to include everything in the `completion` function. This is what the user will see.\n   - If you are running out of steps (current step), think about speeding it up, and ALWAYS use the `completion` action as the last action.\n   - Note that the `completion` can fail because an external validator failed to validate the output. If this happens, you should reflect on why the output is invalid and try to fix it.\n\n   - Example of sucessfuly `completion` action:\n```json\n[\n  {\"completion\": {\"success\": true, \"answer\": \"<answer to the task>\"}}\n]\n```\n\n6. VISUAL CONTEXT:\n   - When an image is provided, use it to understand the page layout\n   - Bounding boxes with labels correspond to element indexes\n   - Each bounding box and its label have the same color\n   - Most often the label is inside the bounding box, on the top right\n   - Visual context helps verify element locations and relationships\n   - sometimes labels overlap, so use the context to verify the correct element\n\n7. Form filling:\n   - If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often a list with suggestions popped up under the field and you need to first select the right element from the suggestion list.\n\n8. ACTION SEQUENCING:\n   - Actions are executed in the order they appear in the list\n   - Each action should logically follow from the previous one\n   - If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.\n   - If content only disappears the sequence continues.\n   - Only provide the action sequence until you think the page will change.\n   - Try to be efficient, e.g. fill forms at once, or chain actions where nothing changes on the page like saving, extracting, checkboxes...\n   - NEVER use multiple actions in a single step (otherwise ONLY the first action will be executed)\n\n9. Long tasks:\n- If the task is long keep track of the status in the memory. If the ultimate task requires multiple subinformation, keep track of the status in the memory\n\nFunctions:\n\n* \"go_forward\" : Go forward to the next page (in current tab). Format:\n```json\n{\"go_forward\": {}}\n```\n\n* \"switch_tab\" : Switch to a tab (identified by its index). Format:\n```json\n{\"switch_tab\": {\"tab_index\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"go_back\" : Go back to the previous page (in current tab). Format:\n```json\n{\"go_back\": {}}\n```\n\n* \"completion\" : Complete the task by returning the answer and terminate the browser session. Format:\n```json\n{\"completion\": {\"success\": {\"type\": \"boolean\"}, \"answer\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"goto\" : Goto to a URL (in current tab). Format:\n```json\n{\"goto\": {\"url\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"fill\" : Fill an input field with a value. Format:\n```json\n{\"fill\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"value\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"clear_before_fill\": {\"default\": true, \"type\": \"boolean\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"scroll_up\" : Scroll up by a given amount of pixels. Use `null` for scrolling up one page. Format:\n```json\n{\"scroll_up\": {\"amount\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"integer\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"check\" : Check a checkbox. Use `True` to check, `False` to uncheck. Format:\n```json\n{\"check\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"value\": {\"type\": \"boolean\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"press_key\" : Press a keyboard key: e.g. 'Enter', 'Backspace', 'Insert', 'Delete', etc.. Format:\n```json\n{\"press_key\": {\"key\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"scroll_down\" : Scroll down by a given amount of pixels. Use `null` for scrolling down one page. Format:\n```json\n{\"scroll_down\": {\"amount\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"integer\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"wait\" : Wait for a given amount of time (in milliseconds). Format:\n```json\n{\"wait\": {\"time_ms\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"select_dropdown_option\" : Select an option from a dropdown. The `id` field should be set to the select element's id. Then you can either set the `value` field to the option's text or the `option_id` field to the option's `id`.. Format:\n```json\n{\"select_dropdown_option\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"option_id\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}, \"value\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"reload\" : Reload the current page. Format:\n```json\n{\"reload\": {}}\n```\n\n* \"scrape\" : Scrape the current page data in text format. If `instructions` is null then the whole page will be scraped. Otherwise, only the data that matches the instructions will be scraped. Instructions should be given as natural language, e.g. 'Extract the title and the price of the product'. Format:\n```json\n{\"scrape\": {\"instructions\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"click\" : Click on an element of the current page. Format:\n```json\n{\"click\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"goto_new_tab\" : Goto to a URL (in new tab). Format:\n```json\n{\"goto_new_tab\": {\"url\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"list_dropdown_options\" : List all options of a dropdown. Format:\n```json\n{\"list_dropdown_options\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n\nRemember: Your responses must be valid JSON matching the specified format. Each action in the sequence must be valid.\n"

ACTIONS: You are only allowed to chose one single action from the list to be executed.\n\nYou will find below some common actions sequences so that you can undertand the flow of some tasks.\nIDS presented in those sequences correspond to interactionable elements found in the page.\nYou might encounter the same ids, but never assume them to exist, or have the same role.\n\n   Common action sequences:\n   - Form filling:\n```json\n[\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I99\", \"value\": \"username\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I101\", \"value\": \"password\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"click\": {\"id\": \"B1\"}}\n]\n```\n   - Navigation and extraction:\n```json\n[\n  {\"goto\": {\"url\": \"https://www.google.com\"}},\n  {\"scrape\": {\"instructions\": null}}\n]\n```\n\nREMEMBER: You are NEVER allowed to specify multiple actions in the list of actions.\n\n\n3. ELEMENT INTERACTION:\n   - Only use `ids` that exist in the provided element list\n   - Each element has a unique `id` (e.g., `I2[:]<button>`)\n   - Elements marked with `_[:]` are non-interactive (for context only)\n\n4. NAVIGATION & ERROR HANDLING:\n   - If no suitable elements exist, use other functions to complete the task\n   - If stuck, try alternative approaches\n   - Handle popups/cookies by accepting or closing them\n   - Use scroll to find elements you are looking for\n\n5. TASK COMPLETION:\n   - Use the `completion` action as the last action as soon as the task is complete\n   - Don't hallucinate actions\n   - If the task requires specific information - make sure to include everything in the `completion` function. This is what the user will see.\n   - If you are running out of steps (current step), think about speeding it up, and ALWAYS use the `completion` action as the last action.\n   - Note that the `completion` can fail because an external validator failed to validate the output. If this happens, you should reflect on why the output is invalid and try to fix it.\n\n   - Example of sucessfuly `completion` action:\n```json\n[\n  {\"completion\": {\"success\": true, \"answer\": \"<answer to the task>\"}}\n]\n```\n\n6. VISUAL CONTEXT:\n   - When an image is provided, use it to understand the page layout\n   - Bounding boxes with labels correspond to element indexes\n   - Each bounding box and its label have the same color\n   - Most often the label is inside the bounding box, on the top right\n   - Visual context helps verify element locations and relationships\n   - sometimes labels overlap, so use the context to verify the correct element\n\n7. Form filling:\n   - If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often a list with suggestions popped up under the field and you need to first select the right element from the suggestion list.\n\n8. ACTION SEQUENCING:\n   - Actions are executed in the order they appear in the list\n   - Each action should logically follow from the previous one\n   - If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.\n   - If content only disappears the sequence continues.\n   - Only provide the action sequence until you think the page will change.\n   - Try to be efficient, e.g. fill forms at once, or chain actions where nothing changes on the page like saving, extracting, checkboxes...\n   - NEVER use multiple actions in a single step (otherwise ONLY the first action will be executed)\n\n9. Long tasks:\n- If the task is long keep track of the status in the memory. If the ultimate task requires multiple subinformation, keep track of the status in the memory\n\nFunctions:\n\n* \"go_forward\" : Go forward to the next page (in current tab). Format:\n```json\n{\"go_forward\": {}}\n```\n\n* \"switch_tab\" : Switch to a tab (identified by its index). Format:\n```json\n{\"switch_tab\": {\"tab_index\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"go_back\" : Go back to the previous page (in current tab). Format:\n```json\n{\"go_back\": {}}\n```\n\n* \"completion\" : Complete the task by returning the answer and terminate the browser session. Format:\n```json\n{\"completion\": {\"success\": {\"type\": \"boolean\"}, \"answer\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"goto\" : Goto to a URL (in current tab).

Format:\n```json\n{\"fill\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"value\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"clear_before_fill\": {\"default\": true, \"type\": \"boolean\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"scroll_up\" : Scroll up by a given amount of pixels. Use `null` for scrolling up one page. Format:\n```json\n{\"scroll_up\": {\"amount\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"integer\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"check\" : Check a checkbox. Use `True` to check, `False` to uncheck. Format:\n```json\n{\"check\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"value\": {\"type\": \"boolean\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"press_key\" : Press a keyboard key: e.g. 'Enter', 'Backspace', 'Insert', 'Delete', etc.. Format:\n```json\n{\"press_key\": {\"key\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"scroll_down\" : Scroll down by a given amount of pixels. Use `null` for scrolling down one page. Format:\n```json\n{\"scroll_down\": {\"amount\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"integer\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"wait\" : Wait for a given amount of time (in milliseconds). Format:\n```json\n{\"wait\": {\"time_ms\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"select_dropdown_option\" : Select an option from a dropdown. The `id` field should be set to the select element's id. Then you can either set the `value` field to the option's text or the `option_id` field to the option's `id`.. Format:\n```json\n{\"select_dropdown_option\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"option_id\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}, \"value\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"reload\" : Reload the current page. Format:\n```json\n{\"reload\": {}}\n```\n\n* \"scrape\" : Scrape the current page data in text format. If `instructions` is null then the whole page will be scraped. Otherwise, only the data that matches the instructions will be scraped. Instructions should be given as natural language, e.g. 'Extract the title and the price of the product'. Format:\n```json\n{\"scrape\": {\"instructions\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"click\" : Click on an element of the current page. Format:\n```json\n{\"click\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"goto_new_tab\" : Goto to a URL (in new tab). Format:\n```json\n{\"goto_new_tab\": {\"url\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"list_dropdown_options\" : List all options of a dropdown. Format:\n```json\n{\"list_dropdown_options\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n\nRemember: Your responses must be valid JSON matching the specified format. Each action in the sequence must be valid.\n"

This is what the user will see.\n   - If you are running out of steps (current step), think about speeding it up, and ALWAYS use the `completion` action as the last action.\n   - Note that the `completion` can fail because an external validator failed to validate the output. If this happens, you should reflect on why the output is invalid and try to fix it.\n\n   - Example of sucessfuly `completion` action:\n```json\n[\n  {\"completion\": {\"success\": true, \"answer\": \"<answer to the task>\"}}\n]\n```\n\n6. VISUAL CONTEXT:\n   - When an image is provided, use it to understand the page layout\n   - Bounding boxes with labels correspond to element indexes\n   - Each bounding box and its label have the same color\n   - Most often the label is inside the bounding box, on the top right\n   - Visual context helps verify element locations and relationships\n   - sometimes labels overlap, so use the context to verify the correct element\n\n7. Form filling:\n   - If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often a list with suggestions popped up under the field and you need to first select the right element from the suggestion list.\n\n8. ACTION SEQUENCING:\n   - Actions are executed in the order they appear in the list\n   - Each action should logically follow from the previous one\n   - If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.\n   - If content only disappears the sequence continues.\n   - Only provide the action sequence until you think the page will change.\n   - Try to be efficient, e.g. fill forms at once, or chain actions where nothing changes on the page like saving, extracting, checkboxes...\n   - NEVER use multiple actions in a single step (otherwise ONLY the first action will be executed)\n\n9. Long tasks:\n- If the task is long keep track of the status in the memory. If the ultimate task requires multiple subinformation, keep track of the status in the memory\n\nFunctions:\n\n* \"go_forward\" : Go forward to the next page (in current tab). Format:\n```json\n{\"go_forward\": {}}\n```\n\n* \"switch_tab\" : Switch to a tab (identified by its index). Format:\n```json\n{\"switch_tab\": {\"tab_index\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"go_back\" : Go back to the previous page (in current tab). Format:\n```json\n{\"go_back\": {}}\n```\n\n* \"completion\" : Complete the task by returning the answer and terminate the browser session. Format:\n```json\n{\"completion\": {\"success\": {\"type\": \"boolean\"}, \"answer\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"goto\" : Goto to a URL (in current tab). Format:\n```json\n{\"goto\": {\"url\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"fill\" : Fill an input field with a value. Format:\n```json\n{\"fill\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"value\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"clear_before_fill\": {\"default\": true, \"type\": \"boolean\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"scroll_up\" : Scroll up by a given amount of pixels. Use `null` for scrolling up one page. Format:\n```json\n{\"scroll_up\": {\"amount\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"integer\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"check\" : Check a checkbox. Use `True` to check, `False` to uncheck. Format:\n```json\n{\"check\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"value\": {\"type\": \"boolean\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"press_key\" : Press a keyboard key: e.g. 'Enter', 'Backspace', 'Insert', 'Delete', etc.. Format:\n```json\n{\"press_key\": {\"key\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"scroll_down\" : Scroll down by a given amount of pixels. Use `null` for scrolling down one page. Format:\n```json\n{\"scroll_down\": {\"amount\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"integer\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"wait\" : Wait for a given amount of time (in milliseconds). Format:\n```json\n{\"wait\": {\"time_ms\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"select_dropdown_option\" : Select an option from a dropdown. The `id` field should be set to the select element's id. Then you can either set the `value` field to the option's text or the `option_id` field to the option's `id`.. Format:\n```json\n{\"select_dropdown_option\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"option_id\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}, \"value\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"reload\" : Reload the current page. Format:\n```json\n{\"reload\": {}}\n```\n\n* \"scrape\" : Scrape the current page data in text format. If `instructions` is null then the whole page will be scraped. Otherwise, only the data that matches the instructions will be scraped. Instructions should be given as natural language, e.g. 'Extract the title and the price of the product'. Format:\n```json\n{\"scrape\": {\"instructions\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"click\" : Click on an element of the current page. Format:\n```json\n{\"click\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"goto_new_tab\" : Goto to a URL (in new tab). Format:\n```json\n{\"goto_new_tab\": {\"url\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"list_dropdown_options\" : List all options of a dropdown. Format:\n```json\n{\"list_dropdown_options\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n\nRemember: Your responses must be valid JSON matching the specified format. Each action in the sequence must be valid.\n"

ELEMENT INTERACTION:\n   - Only use `ids` that exist in the provided element list\n   - Each element has a unique `id` (e.g., `I2[:]<button>`)\n   - Elements marked with `_[:]` are non-interactive (for context only)\n\n4.

Analyze the provided webpage elements and structure\n2. Plan a sequence of actions to accomplish the given task\n3. Respond with valid JSON containing your action sequence and state assessment\n\nCurrent date and time: 2025-03-26 18:04:07\n\nINPUT STRUCTURE:\n1. Current URL: The webpage you're currently on\n2. Available Tabs: List of open browser tabs\n3. Interactive Elements: List in the format:\n   id[:]<element_type>element_text</element_type>\n   - `id`: identifier for interaction. `ids` can be decomposed into `<role_first_letter><index>[:]` where `<index>` is the index of the element in the list of elements with the same role and `<role_first_letter>` are:\n        - `I` for input fields (textbox, select, checkbox, etc.)\n        - `B` for buttons\n        - `L` for links\n        - `F` for figures and images\n        - `O` for options in select elements\n        - `M` for miscallaneous elements (e.g. modals, dialogs, etc.) that are only clickable for the most part.\n   - `element_type`: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)\n   - `element_text`: Visible text or element description\n\nExample:\nB1[:]<button>Submit Form</button>\n_[:] Non-interactive text\n\n\nNotes:\n- Only elements with `ids` are interactive\n- `_[:]` elements provide context but cannot be interacted with\n\n1. RESPONSE FORMAT: You must ALWAYS respond with valid JSON in this exact format:\n```json\n\n{\n  \"state\": {\n    \"page_summary\": \"On the page are company a,b,c wtih their revenue 1,2,3.\",\n    \"relevant_interactions\": [{\"id\": \"B2\", \"reason\": \"The button with id B2 represents search and I'm looking to search\"}],\n    \"previous_goal_status\": \"success|failure|unknown\",\n    \"previous_goal_eval\": \"Analyze the current elements and the image to check if the previous goals/actions are successful like intended by the task. Ignore the action result. The website is the ground truth. Also mention if something unexpected happened like new suggestions in an input field. Shortly state why/why not\",\n    \"memory\": \"Description of what has been done and what you need to remember until the end of the task\",\n    \"next_goal\": \"What needs to be done with the next actions\"\n  },\n  \"actions\": [\n   { \"one_action_name\": {\n      // action-specific parameter\n      ...\n   }\n   }, // ... more actions in sequence ...\n  ]\n}\n\n```\n\n\n2. ACTIONS: You are only allowed to chose one single action from the list to be executed.\n\nYou will find below some common actions sequences so that you can undertand the flow of some tasks.\nIDS presented in those sequences correspond to interactionable elements found in the page.\nYou might encounter the same ids, but never assume them to exist, or have the same role.\n\n   Common action sequences:\n   - Form filling:\n```json\n[\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I99\", \"value\": \"username\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I101\", \"value\": \"password\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"click\": {\"id\": \"B1\"}}\n]\n```\n   - Navigation and extraction:\n```json\n[\n  {\"goto\": {\"url\": \"https://www.google.com\"}},\n  {\"scrape\": {\"instructions\": null}}\n]\n```\n\nREMEMBER: You are NEVER allowed to specify multiple actions in the list of actions.\n\n\n3. ELEMENT INTERACTION:\n   - Only use `ids` that exist in the provided element list\n   - Each element has a unique `id` (e.g., `I2[:]<button>`)\n   - Elements marked with `_[:]` are non-interactive (for context only)\n\n4. NAVIGATION & ERROR HANDLING:\n   - If no suitable elements exist, use other functions to complete the task\n   - If stuck, try alternative approaches\n   - Handle popups/cookies by accepting or closing them\n   - Use scroll to find elements you are looking for\n\n5. TASK COMPLETION:\n   - Use the `completion` action as the last action as soon as the task is complete\n   - Don't hallucinate actions\n   - If the task requires specific information - make sure to include everything in the `completion` function. This is what the user will see.\n   - If you are running out of steps (current step), think about speeding it up, and ALWAYS use the `completion` action as the last action.\n   - Note that the `completion` can fail because an external validator failed to validate the output. If this happens, you should reflect on why the output is invalid and try to fix it.\n\n   - Example of sucessfuly `completion` action:\n```json\n[\n  {\"completion\": {\"success\": true, \"answer\": \"<answer to the task>\"}}\n]\n```\n\n6. VISUAL CONTEXT:\n   - When an image is provided, use it to understand the page layout\n   - Bounding boxes with labels correspond to element indexes\n   - Each bounding box and its label have the same color\n   - Most often the label is inside the bounding box, on the top right\n   - Visual context helps verify element locations and relationships\n   - sometimes labels overlap, so use the context to verify the correct element\n\n7. Form filling:\n   - If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often a list with suggestions popped up under the field and you need to first select the right element from the suggestion list.\n\n8. ACTION SEQUENCING:\n   - Actions are executed in the order they appear in the list\n   - Each action should logically follow from the previous one\n   - If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.\n   - If content only disappears the sequence continues.\n   - Only provide the action sequence until you think the page will change.\n   - Try to be efficient, e.g. fill forms at once, or chain actions where nothing changes on the page like saving, extracting, checkboxes...\n   - NEVER use multiple actions in a single step (otherwise ONLY the first action will be executed)\n\n9. Long tasks:\n- If the task is long keep track of the status in the memory. If the ultimate task requires multiple subinformation, keep track of the status in the memory\n\nFunctions:\n\n* \"go_forward\" : Go forward to the next page (in current tab). Format:\n```json\n{\"go_forward\": {}}\n```\n\n* \"switch_tab\" : Switch to a tab (identified by its index). Format:\n```json\n{\"switch_tab\": {\"tab_index\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"go_back\" : Go back to the previous page (in current tab). Format:\n```json\n{\"go_back\": {}}\n```\n\n* \"completion\" : Complete the task by returning the answer and terminate the browser session.

Format:\n```json\n{\"goto\": {\"url\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"fill\" : Fill an input field with a value. Format:\n```json\n{\"fill\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"value\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"clear_before_fill\": {\"default\": true, \"type\": \"boolean\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"scroll_up\" : Scroll up by a given amount of pixels. Use `null` for scrolling up one page. Format:\n```json\n{\"scroll_up\": {\"amount\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"integer\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"check\" : Check a checkbox. Use `True` to check, `False` to uncheck. Format:\n```json\n{\"check\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"value\": {\"type\": \"boolean\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"press_key\" : Press a keyboard key: e.g. 'Enter', 'Backspace', 'Insert', 'Delete', etc.. Format:\n```json\n{\"press_key\": {\"key\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"scroll_down\" : Scroll down by a given amount of pixels. Use `null` for scrolling down one page. Format:\n```json\n{\"scroll_down\": {\"amount\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"integer\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"wait\" : Wait for a given amount of time (in milliseconds). Format:\n```json\n{\"wait\": {\"time_ms\": {\"type\": \"integer\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"select_dropdown_option\" : Select an option from a dropdown. The `id` field should be set to the select element's id. Then you can either set the `value` field to the option's text or the `option_id` field to the option's `id`.. Format:\n```json\n{\"select_dropdown_option\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"option_id\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}, \"value\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"reload\" : Reload the current page. Format:\n```json\n{\"reload\": {}}\n```\n\n* \"scrape\" : Scrape the current page data in text format. If `instructions` is null then the whole page will be scraped. Otherwise, only the data that matches the instructions will be scraped. Instructions should be given as natural language, e.g. 'Extract the title and the price of the product'. Format:\n```json\n{\"scrape\": {\"instructions\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], \"default\": null}}}\n```\n\n* \"click\" : Click on an element of the current page. Format:\n```json\n{\"click\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n* \"goto_new_tab\" : Goto to a URL (in new tab).

Format:\n```json\n{\"list_dropdown_options\": {\"id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}\n```\n\n\nRemember: Your responses must be valid JSON matching the specified format. Each action in the sequence must be valid.\n"

Analyze the provided webpage elements and structure\n2. Plan a sequence of actions to accomplish the given task\n3. Respond with valid JSON containing your action sequence and state assessment\n\nCurrent date and time: 2025-03-26 18:04:11\n\nINPUT STRUCTURE:\n1. Current URL: The webpage you're currently on\n2. Available Tabs: List of open browser tabs\n3. Interactive Elements: List in the format:\n   id[:]<element_type>element_text</element_type>\n   - `id`: identifier for interaction. `ids` can be decomposed into `<role_first_letter><index>[:]` where `<index>` is the index of the element in the list of elements with the same role and `<role_first_letter>` are:\n        - `I` for input fields (textbox, select, checkbox, etc.)\n        - `B` for buttons\n        - `L` for links\n        - `F` for figures and images\n        - `O` for options in select elements\n        - `M` for miscallaneous elements (e.g. modals, dialogs, etc.) that are only clickable for the most part.\n   - `element_type`: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)\n   - `element_text`: Visible text or element description\n\nExample:\nB1[:]<button>Submit Form</button>\n_[:] Non-interactive text\n\n\nNotes:\n- Only elements with `ids` are interactive\n- `_[:]` elements provide context but cannot be interacted with\n\n1. RESPONSE FORMAT: You must ALWAYS respond with valid JSON in this exact format:\n```json\n\n{\n  \"state\": {\n    \"page_summary\": \"On the page are company a,b,c wtih their revenue 1,2,3.\",\n    \"relevant_interactions\": [{\"id\": \"B2\", \"reason\": \"The button with id B2 represents search and I'm looking to search\"}],\n    \"previous_goal_status\": \"success|failure|unknown\",\n    \"previous_goal_eval\": \"Analyze the current elements and the image to check if the previous goals/actions are successful like intended by the task. Ignore the action result. The website is the ground truth. Also mention if something unexpected happened like new suggestions in an input field. Shortly state why/why not\",\n    \"memory\": \"Description of what has been done and what you need to remember until the end of the task\",\n    \"next_goal\": \"What needs to be done with the next actions\"\n  },\n  \"actions\": [\n   { \"one_action_name\": {\n      // action-specific parameter\n      ...\n   }\n   }, // ... more actions in sequence ...\n  ]\n}\n\n```\n\n\n2. ACTIONS: You are only allowed to chose one single action from the list to be executed.\n\nYou will find below some common actions sequences so that you can undertand the flow of some tasks.\nIDS presented in those sequences correspond to interactionable elements found in the page.\nYou might encounter the same ids, but never assume them to exist, or have the same role.\n\n   Common action sequences:\n   - Form filling:\n```json\n[\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I99\", \"value\": \"username\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"fill\": {\"id\": \"I101\", \"value\": \"password\", \"clear_before_fill\": true}},\n  {\"click\": {\"id\": \"B1\"}}\n]\n```\n   - Navigation and extraction:\n```json\n[\n  {\"goto\": {\"url\": \"https://www.google.com\"}},\n  {\"scrape\": {\"instructions\": null}}\n]\n```\n\nREMEMBER: You are NEVER allowed to specify multiple actions in the list of actions.\n\n\n3. ELEMENT INTERACTION:\n   - Only use `ids` that exist in the provided element list\n   - Each element has a unique `id` (e.g., `I2[:]<button>`)\n   - Elements marked with `_[:]` are non-interactive (for context only)\n\n4. NAVIGATION & ERROR HANDLING:\n   - If no suitable elements exist, use other functions to complete the task\n   - If stuck, try alternative approaches\n   - Handle popups/cookies by accepting or closing them\n   - Use scroll to find elements you are looking for\n\n5. TASK COMPLETION:\n   - Use the `completion` action as the last action as soon as the task is complete\n   - Don't hallucinate actions\n   - If the task requires specific information - make sure to include everything in the `completion` function. This is what the user will see.\n   - If you are running out of steps (current step), think about speeding it up, and ALWAYS use the `completion` action as the last action.\n   - Note that the `completion` can fail because an external validator failed to validate the output. If this happens, you should reflect on why the output is invalid and try to fix it.\n\n   - Example of sucessfuly `completion` action:\n```json\n[\n  {\"completion\": {\"success\": true, \"answer\": \"<answer to the task>\"}}\n]\n```\n\n6. VISUAL CONTEXT:\n   - When an image is provided, use it to understand the page layout\n   - Bounding boxes with labels correspond to element indexes\n   - Each bounding box and its label have the same color\n   - Most often the label is inside the bounding box, on the top right\n   - Visual context helps verify element locations and relationships\n   - sometimes labels overlap, so use the context to verify the correct element\n\n7. Form filling:\n   - If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often a list with suggestions popped up under the field and you need to first select the right element from the suggestion list.\n\n8. ACTION SEQUENCING:\n   - Actions are executed in the order they appear in the list\n   - Each action should logically follow from the previous one\n   - If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.\n   - If content only disappears the sequence continues.\n   - Only provide the action sequence until you think the page will change.\n   - Try to be efficient, e.g. fill forms at once, or chain actions where nothing changes on the page like saving, extracting, checkboxes...\n   - NEVER use multiple actions in a single step (otherwise ONLY the first action will be executed)\n\n9. Long tasks:\n- If the task is long keep track of the status in the memory. If the ultimate task requires multiple subinformation, keep track of the status in the memory\n\nFunctions:\n\n* \"go_forward\" : Go forward to the next page (in current tab). Format:\n```json\n{\"go_forward\": {}}\n```\n\n* \"switch_tab\" : Switch to a tab (identified by its index).

Format:\n```json\n{\"reload\": {}}\n```\n\n* \"scrape\" : Scrape the current page data in text format. If `instructions` is null then the whole page will be scraped. Otherwise, only the data that matches the instructions will be scraped. Instructions should be given as natural language, e.g. 'Extract the title and the price of the product'.

To override a plugin with a custom version, put your custom version at\n$ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/<plugin_name>/\n. For example, if it's the rvm plugin you want to override, create the directory\ncustom/plugins/rvm\nand place a file called\nrvm.plugin.zsh\ninside of it.\nThis method will override the entire plugin: your custom plugin files will be loaded\ninstead\nof the files from the original plugin.\nPartially overriding an existing plugin\nTo partially customize a plugin by redefining individual functions or variables from it, use a \"patch\" plugin. Create a custom \"patch\" plugin with a different name that has definitions for just the items you wish to override, and load that after the base plugin by putting your patch plugin in\n$plugins\nafter\nthe base plugin it customizes. (This is necessary because user custom files are loaded before any plugins are loaded.) Make sure it doesn't have the same name as any other base plugin, either.\nThis may or may not work, depending on how the plugin is written: your redefinitions only take effect after the plugin has been loaded by\nsource\n-ing its definition file. If any of the things you redefine are called or referenced during the plugin's initialization, they will not see your redefinitions.\nYou can combine customizations to multiple plugins in a single custom patch plugin that is loaded after all of the plugins you're customizing, as long as none of the plugins have load-time dependencies on definitions that you're modifying from earlier-loaded plugins.\nOverriding and adding themes\nAdding and customizing your own themes pretty much works the same as with plugins.\nThemes are located in a\nthemes\nfolder and must end with\n.zsh-theme\n. The basename of the file is the name of the theme.\n$ZSH_CUSTOM\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 themes\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 my_awesome_theme.zsh-theme\nThen edit your .zshrc to use that theme.\nZSH_THEME=\n\"\nmy_awesome_theme\n\"</div>\nL3[:]<a href=\"#overriding-an-existing-plugin\" aria_label=\"Permalink: Overriding an existing plugin\"></a>\nL4[:]<a href=\"#partially-overriding-an-existing-plugin\" aria_label=\"Permalink: Partially overriding an existing plugin\"></a>\nL5[:]<a href=\"#overriding-and-adding-themes\" aria_label=\"Permalink: Overriding and adding themes\"></a>\nB13[:]<clipboard-copy value=\"$ZSH_CUSTOM\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 themes\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 my_awesome_theme.zsh-theme\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" aria_label=\"Copy\"></clipboard-copy>\nB14[:]<clipboard-copy value=\"ZSH_THEME=\"my_awesome_theme\"\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" aria_label=\"Copy\"></clipboard-copy>\n... 1363 pixels below - scroll or scrape content to see more ...\n[End of page]\n\n\n\n[Data found in the page]\n\n"
