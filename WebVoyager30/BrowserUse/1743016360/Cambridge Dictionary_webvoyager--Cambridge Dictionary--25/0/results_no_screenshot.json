Your goal is to accomplish the ultimate task following the rules.\n\n# Input Format\nTask\nPrevious steps\nCurrent URL\nOpen Tabs\nInteractive Elements\n[index]<type>text</type>\n- index: Numeric identifier for interaction\n- type: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)\n- text: Element description\nExample:\n[33]<button>Submit Form</button>\n\n- Only elements with numeric indexes in [] are interactive\n- elements without [] provide only context\n\n# Response Rules\n1. RESPONSE FORMAT: You must ALWAYS respond with valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\"current_state\": {\"evaluation_previous_goal\": \"Success|Failed|Unknown - Analyze the current elements and the image to check if the previous goals/actions are successful like intended by the task. Mention if something unexpected happened. Shortly state why/why not\",\n\"memory\": \"Description of what has been done and what you need to remember. Be very specific. Count here ALWAYS how many times you have done something and how many remain. E.g. 0 out of 10 websites analyzed. Continue with abc and xyz\",\n\"next_goal\": \"What needs to be done with the next immediate action\"},\n\"action\":[{\"one_action_name\": {// action-specific parameter}}, // ... more actions in sequence]}\n\n2. ACTIONS: You can specify multiple actions in the list to be executed in sequence. But always specify only one action name per item. Use maximum {max_actions} actions per sequence.\nCommon action sequences:\n- Form filling: [{\"input_text\": {\"index\": 1, \"text\": \"username\"}}, {\"input_text\": {\"index\": 2, \"text\": \"password\"}}, {\"click_element\": {\"index\": 3}}]\n- Navigation and extraction: [{\"go_to_url\": {\"url\": \"https://example.com\"}}, {\"extract_content\": {\"goal\": \"extract the names\"}}]\n- Actions are executed in the given order\n- If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.\n- Only provide the action sequence until an action which changes the page state significantly.\n- Try to be efficient, e.g. fill forms at once, or chain actions where nothing changes on the page\n- only use multiple actions if it makes sense.\n\n3. ELEMENT INTERACTION:\n- Only use indexes of the interactive elements\n- Elements marked with \"[]Non-interactive text\" are non-interactive\n\n4. NAVIGATION & ERROR HANDLING:\n- If no suitable elements exist, use other functions to complete the task\n- If stuck, try alternative approaches - like going back to a previous page, new search, new tab etc.\n- Handle popups/cookies by accepting or closing them\n- Use scroll to find elements you are looking for\n- If you want to research something, open a new tab instead of using the current tab\n- If captcha pops up, try to solve it - else try a different approach\n- If the page is not fully loaded, use wait action\n\n5. TASK COMPLETION:\n- Use the done action as the last action as soon as the ultimate task is complete\n- Dont use \"done\" before you are done with everything the user asked you, except you reach the last step of max_steps. \n- If you reach your last step, use the done action even if the task is not fully finished. Provide all the information you have gathered so far. If the ultimate task is completly finished set success to true. If not everything the user asked for is completed set success in done to false!\n- If you have to do something repeatedly for example the task says for \"each\", or \"for all\", or \"x times\", count always inside \"memory\" how many times you have done it and how many remain. Don't stop until you have completed like the task asked you. Only call done after the last step.\n- Don't hallucinate actions\n- Make sure you include everything you found out for the ultimate task in the done text parameter. Do not just say you are done, but include the requested information of the task. \n\n6. VISUAL CONTEXT:\n- When an image is provided, use it to understand the page layout\n- Bounding boxes with labels on their top right corner correspond to element indexes\n\n7. Form filling:\n- If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often something changed e.g. suggestions popped up under the field.\n\n8. Long tasks:\n- Keep track of the status and subresults in the memory. \n\n9. Extraction:\n- If your task is to find information - call extract_content on the specific pages to get and store the information.\nYour responses must be always JSON with the specified format. ",

              "content": "You are an AI agent designed to automate browser tasks. Your goal is to accomplish the ultimate task following the rules.\n\n# Input Format\nTask\nPrevious steps\nCurrent URL\nOpen Tabs\nInteractive Elements\n[index]<type>text</type>\n- index: Numeric identifier for interaction\n- type: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)\n- text: Element description\nExample:\n[33]<button>Submit Form</button>\n\n- Only elements with numeric indexes in [] are interactive\n- elements without [] provide only context\n\n# Response Rules\n1. RESPONSE FORMAT: You must ALWAYS respond with valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\"current_state\": {\"evaluation_previous_goal\": \"Success|Failed|Unknown - Analyze the current elements and the image to check if the previous goals/actions are successful like intended by the task. Mention if something unexpected happened. Shortly state why/why not\",\n\"memory\": \"Description of what has been done and what you need to remember. Be very specific. Count here ALWAYS how many times you have done something and how many remain. E.g. 0 out of 10 websites analyzed. Continue with abc and xyz\",\n\"next_goal\": \"What needs to be done with the next immediate action\"},\n\"action\":[{\"one_action_name\": {// action-specific parameter}}, // ... more actions in sequence]}\n\n2. ACTIONS: You can specify multiple actions in the list to be executed in sequence. But always specify only one action name per item. Use maximum {max_actions} actions per sequence.\nCommon action sequences:\n- Form filling: [{\"input_text\": {\"index\": 1, \"text\": \"username\"}}, {\"input_text\": {\"index\": 2, \"text\": \"password\"}}, {\"click_element\": {\"index\": 3}}]\n- Navigation and extraction: [{\"go_to_url\": {\"url\": \"https://example.com\"}}, {\"extract_content\": {\"goal\": \"extract the names\"}}]\n- Actions are executed in the given order\n- If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.\n- Only provide the action sequence until an action which changes the page state significantly.\n- Try to be efficient, e.g. fill forms at once, or chain actions where nothing changes on the page\n- only use multiple actions if it makes sense.\n\n3. ELEMENT INTERACTION:\n- Only use indexes of the interactive elements\n- Elements marked with \"[]Non-interactive text\" are non-interactive\n\n4. NAVIGATION & ERROR HANDLING:\n- If no suitable elements exist, use other functions to complete the task\n- If stuck, try alternative approaches - like going back to a previous page, new search, new tab etc.\n- Handle popups/cookies by accepting or closing them\n- Use scroll to find elements you are looking for\n- If you want to research something, open a new tab instead of using the current tab\n- If captcha pops up, try to solve it - else try a different approach\n- If the page is not fully loaded, use wait action\n\n5. TASK COMPLETION:\n- Use the done action as the last action as soon as the ultimate task is complete\n- Dont use \"done\" before you are done with everything the user asked you, except you reach the last step of max_steps. \n- If you reach your last step, use the done action even if the task is not fully finished. Provide all the information you have gathered so far. If the ultimate task is completly finished set success to true. If not everything the user asked for is completed set success in done to false!\n- If you have to do something repeatedly for example the task says for \"each\", or \"for all\", or \"x times\", count always inside \"memory\" how many times you have done it and how many remain. Don't stop until you have completed like the task asked you. Only call done after the last step.\n- Don't hallucinate actions\n- Make sure you include everything you found out for the ultimate task in the done text parameter. Do not just say you are done, but include the requested information of the task. \n\n6. VISUAL CONTEXT:\n- When an image is provided, use it to understand the page layout\n- Bounding boxes with labels on their top right corner correspond to element indexes\n\n7. Form filling:\n- If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often something changed e.g. suggestions popped up under the field.\n\n8. Long tasks:\n- Keep track of the status and subresults in the memory. \n\n9. Extraction:\n- If your task is to find information - call extract_content on the specific pages to get and store the information.\nYour responses must be always JSON with the specified format. ",

              "content": "You are an AI agent designed to automate browser tasks. Your goal is to accomplish the ultimate task following the rules.\n\n# Input Format\nTask\nPrevious steps\nCurrent URL\nOpen Tabs\nInteractive Elements\n[index]<type>text</type>\n- index: Numeric identifier for interaction\n- type: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)\n- text: Element description\nExample:\n[33]<button>Submit Form</button>\n\n- Only elements with numeric indexes in [] are interactive\n- elements without [] provide only context\n\n# Response Rules\n1. RESPONSE FORMAT: You must ALWAYS respond with valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\"current_state\": {\"evaluation_previous_goal\": \"Success|Failed|Unknown - Analyze the current elements and the image to check if the previous goals/actions are successful like intended by the task. Mention if something unexpected happened. Shortly state why/why not\",\n\"memory\": \"Description of what has been done and what you need to remember. Be very specific. Count here ALWAYS how many times you have done something and how many remain. E.g. 0 out of 10 websites analyzed. Continue with abc and xyz\",\n\"next_goal\": \"What needs to be done with the next immediate action\"},\n\"action\":[{\"one_action_name\": {// action-specific parameter}}, // ... more actions in sequence]}\n\n2. ACTIONS: You can specify multiple actions in the list to be executed in sequence. But always specify only one action name per item. Use maximum {max_actions} actions per sequence.\nCommon action sequences:\n- Form filling: [{\"input_text\": {\"index\": 1, \"text\": \"username\"}}, {\"input_text\": {\"index\": 2, \"text\": \"password\"}}, {\"click_element\": {\"index\": 3}}]\n- Navigation and extraction: [{\"go_to_url\": {\"url\": \"https://example.com\"}}, {\"extract_content\": {\"goal\": \"extract the names\"}}]\n- Actions are executed in the given order\n- If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.\n- Only provide the action sequence until an action which changes the page state significantly.\n- Try to be efficient, e.g. fill forms at once, or chain actions where nothing changes on the page\n- only use multiple actions if it makes sense.\n\n3. ELEMENT INTERACTION:\n- Only use indexes of the interactive elements\n- Elements marked with \"[]Non-interactive text\" are non-interactive\n\n4. NAVIGATION & ERROR HANDLING:\n- If no suitable elements exist, use other functions to complete the task\n- If stuck, try alternative approaches - like going back to a previous page, new search, new tab etc.\n- Handle popups/cookies by accepting or closing them\n- Use scroll to find elements you are looking for\n- If you want to research something, open a new tab instead of using the current tab\n- If captcha pops up, try to solve it - else try a different approach\n- If the page is not fully loaded, use wait action\n\n5. TASK COMPLETION:\n- Use the done action as the last action as soon as the ultimate task is complete\n- Dont use \"done\" before you are done with everything the user asked you, except you reach the last step of max_steps. \n- If you reach your last step, use the done action even if the task is not fully finished. Provide all the information you have gathered so far. If the ultimate task is completly finished set success to true. If not everything the user asked for is completed set success in done to false!\n- If you have to do something repeatedly for example the task says for \"each\", or \"for all\", or \"x times\", count always inside \"memory\" how many times you have done it and how many remain. Don't stop until you have completed like the task asked you. Only call done after the last step.\n- Don't hallucinate actions\n- Make sure you include everything you found out for the ultimate task in the done text parameter. Do not just say you are done, but include the requested information of the task. \n\n6. VISUAL CONTEXT:\n- When an image is provided, use it to understand the page layout\n- Bounding boxes with labels on their top right corner correspond to element indexes\n\n7. Form filling:\n- If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often something changed e.g. suggestions popped up under the field.\n\n8. Long tasks:\n- Keep track of the status and subresults in the memory. \n\n9. Extraction:\n- If your task is to find information - call extract_content on the specific pages to get and store the information.\nYour responses must be always JSON with the specified format. ",

              "content": "You are an AI agent designed to automate browser tasks. Your goal is to accomplish the ultimate task following the rules.\n\n# Input Format\nTask\nPrevious steps\nCurrent URL\nOpen Tabs\nInteractive Elements\n[index]<type>text</type>\n- index: Numeric identifier for interaction\n- type: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)\n- text: Element description\nExample:\n[33]<button>Submit Form</button>\n\n- Only elements with numeric indexes in [] are interactive\n- elements without [] provide only context\n\n# Response Rules\n1. RESPONSE FORMAT: You must ALWAYS respond with valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\"current_state\": {\"evaluation_previous_goal\": \"Success|Failed|Unknown - Analyze the current elements and the image to check if the previous goals/actions are successful like intended by the task. Mention if something unexpected happened. Shortly state why/why not\",\n\"memory\": \"Description of what has been done and what you need to remember. Be very specific. Count here ALWAYS how many times you have done something and how many remain. E.g. 0 out of 10 websites analyzed. Continue with abc and xyz\",\n\"next_goal\": \"What needs to be done with the next immediate action\"},\n\"action\":[{\"one_action_name\": {// action-specific parameter}}, // ... more actions in sequence]}\n\n2. ACTIONS: You can specify multiple actions in the list to be executed in sequence. But always specify only one action name per item. Use maximum {max_actions} actions per sequence.\nCommon action sequences:\n- Form filling: [{\"input_text\": {\"index\": 1, \"text\": \"username\"}}, {\"input_text\": {\"index\": 2, \"text\": \"password\"}}, {\"click_element\": {\"index\": 3}}]\n- Navigation and extraction: [{\"go_to_url\": {\"url\": \"https://example.com\"}}, {\"extract_content\": {\"goal\": \"extract the names\"}}]\n- Actions are executed in the given order\n- If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.\n- Only provide the action sequence until an action which changes the page state significantly.\n- Try to be efficient, e.g. fill forms at once, or chain actions where nothing changes on the page\n- only use multiple actions if it makes sense.\n\n3. ELEMENT INTERACTION:\n- Only use indexes of the interactive elements\n- Elements marked with \"[]Non-interactive text\" are non-interactive\n\n4. NAVIGATION & ERROR HANDLING:\n- If no suitable elements exist, use other functions to complete the task\n- If stuck, try alternative approaches - like going back to a previous page, new search, new tab etc.\n- Handle popups/cookies by accepting or closing them\n- Use scroll to find elements you are looking for\n- If you want to research something, open a new tab instead of using the current tab\n- If captcha pops up, try to solve it - else try a different approach\n- If the page is not fully loaded, use wait action\n\n5. TASK COMPLETION:\n- Use the done action as the last action as soon as the ultimate task is complete\n- Dont use \"done\" before you are done with everything the user asked you, except you reach the last step of max_steps. \n- If you reach your last step, use the done action even if the task is not fully finished. Provide all the information you have gathered so far. If the ultimate task is completly finished set success to true. If not everything the user asked for is completed set success in done to false!\n- If you have to do something repeatedly for example the task says for \"each\", or \"for all\", or \"x times\", count always inside \"memory\" how many times you have done it and how many remain. Don't stop until you have completed like the task asked you. Only call done after the last step.\n- Don't hallucinate actions\n- Make sure you include everything you found out for the ultimate task in the done text parameter. Do not just say you are done, but include the requested information of the task. \n\n6. VISUAL CONTEXT:\n- When an image is provided, use it to understand the page layout\n- Bounding boxes with labels on their top right corner correspond to element indexes\n\n7. Form filling:\n- If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often something changed e.g. suggestions popped up under the field.\n\n8. Long tasks:\n- Keep track of the status and subresults in the memory. \n\n9. Extraction:\n- If your task is to find information - call extract_content on the specific pages to get and store the information.\nYour responses must be always JSON with the specified format. ",

Today\u2019s post features \u2018eye\u2019 phrases on a range of themes.\nLet\u2019s start with a couple of romantic expressions. If two strangers\u2019\neyes meet\nacross a crowded room\n, they look at each other in a public place and immediately form a romantic connection. Meanwhile, if someone\n[27]<a only has eyes for/>\none person, they love that person\u00a0romantically and no one else:\nOur eyes met across a crowded room, and it was love at first sight.\nHe only had eyes for Isabel and was a devoted husband.\nPerhaps not surprisingly, two \u2018eye\u2019 expressions are related to crying. Something that\nbrings a tear to the/your eye\nmakes you cry a little, and if you say of an occasion that there\n[28]<a wasn\u2019t a dry eye in the house/>\n, you mean many people were emotional and crying, usually in response to something such as a speech or a performance:\nThat scene where they say goodbye still brings a tear to my eye.\nThere wasn\u2019t a dry eye in the house during the wedding service.\nSomething that happens\n[29]<a in the blink of an eye/>\nor\n[30]<a in the twinkling of an eye/>\nhappens \u2013 or seems to happen \u2013 extremely quickly:\n[31]<img />\nSearch for:\n[32]<input search;s;Search \u2026;Search for:/>\n[33]<button submit>Search/>\nTop posts\n[34]<a It costs a fortune: talking about high prices/>\n[35]<img />\n[36]<a New words \u2013 24 March 2025/>\n[37]<img />\n[38]<a When life gives you lemons\u2026 (Fruit idioms)/>\n[39]<img />\n[40]<a New words \u2013 17 March 2025/>\n[41]<img />\n[42]<a I would of done it: understanding non-standard grammar forms (2)/>\n[43]<img />\n[44]<a We was hungry: understanding non-standard grammar forms (1)/>\n[45]<img />\nAuthors\n... 3891 pixels below - scroll or extract content to see more ...\nCurrent step: 7/20Current date and time: 2025-03-26 21:58\n"

              "content": "You are an AI agent designed to automate browser tasks. Your goal is to accomplish the ultimate task following the rules.\n\n# Input Format\nTask\nPrevious steps\nCurrent URL\nOpen Tabs\nInteractive Elements\n[index]<type>text</type>\n- index: Numeric identifier for interaction\n- type: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)\n- text: Element description\nExample:\n[33]<button>Submit Form</button>\n\n- Only elements with numeric indexes in [] are interactive\n- elements without [] provide only context\n\n# Response Rules\n1. RESPONSE FORMAT: You must ALWAYS respond with valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\"current_state\": {\"evaluation_previous_goal\": \"Success|Failed|Unknown - Analyze the current elements and the image to check if the previous goals/actions are successful like intended by the task. Mention if something unexpected happened. Shortly state why/why not\",\n\"memory\": \"Description of what has been done and what you need to remember. Be very specific. Count here ALWAYS how many times you have done something and how many remain. E.g. 0 out of 10 websites analyzed. Continue with abc and xyz\",\n\"next_goal\": \"What needs to be done with the next immediate action\"},\n\"action\":[{\"one_action_name\": {// action-specific parameter}}, // ... more actions in sequence]}\n\n2. ACTIONS: You can specify multiple actions in the list to be executed in sequence. But always specify only one action name per item. Use maximum {max_actions} actions per sequence.\nCommon action sequences:\n- Form filling: [{\"input_text\": {\"index\": 1, \"text\": \"username\"}}, {\"input_text\": {\"index\": 2, \"text\": \"password\"}}, {\"click_element\": {\"index\": 3}}]\n- Navigation and extraction: [{\"go_to_url\": {\"url\": \"https://example.com\"}}, {\"extract_content\": {\"goal\": \"extract the names\"}}]\n- Actions are executed in the given order\n- If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.\n- Only provide the action sequence until an action which changes the page state significantly.\n- Try to be efficient, e.g. fill forms at once, or chain actions where nothing changes on the page\n- only use multiple actions if it makes sense.\n\n3. ELEMENT INTERACTION:\n- Only use indexes of the interactive elements\n- Elements marked with \"[]Non-interactive text\" are non-interactive\n\n4. NAVIGATION & ERROR HANDLING:\n- If no suitable elements exist, use other functions to complete the task\n- If stuck, try alternative approaches - like going back to a previous page, new search, new tab etc.\n- Handle popups/cookies by accepting or closing them\n- Use scroll to find elements you are looking for\n- If you want to research something, open a new tab instead of using the current tab\n- If captcha pops up, try to solve it - else try a different approach\n- If the page is not fully loaded, use wait action\n\n5. TASK COMPLETION:\n- Use the done action as the last action as soon as the ultimate task is complete\n- Dont use \"done\" before you are done with everything the user asked you, except you reach the last step of max_steps. \n- If you reach your last step, use the done action even if the task is not fully finished. Provide all the information you have gathered so far. If the ultimate task is completly finished set success to true. If not everything the user asked for is completed set success in done to false!\n- If you have to do something repeatedly for example the task says for \"each\", or \"for all\", or \"x times\", count always inside \"memory\" how many times you have done it and how many remain. Don't stop until you have completed like the task asked you. Only call done after the last step.\n- Don't hallucinate actions\n- Make sure you include everything you found out for the ultimate task in the done text parameter. Do not just say you are done, but include the requested information of the task. \n\n6. VISUAL CONTEXT:\n- When an image is provided, use it to understand the page layout\n- Bounding boxes with labels on their top right corner correspond to element indexes\n\n7. Form filling:\n- If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often something changed e.g. suggestions popped up under the field.\n\n8. Long tasks:\n- Keep track of the status and subresults in the memory. \n\n9. Extraction:\n- If your task is to find information - call extract_content on the specific pages to get and store the information.\nYour responses must be always JSON with the specified format. ",

Today\u2019s post features \u2018eye\u2019 phrases on a range of themes.\nLet\u2019s start with a couple of romantic expressions. If two strangers\u2019\neyes meet\nacross a crowded room\n, they look at each other in a public place and immediately form a romantic connection. Meanwhile, if someone\n[27]<a only has eyes for/>\none person, they love that person\u00a0romantically and no one else:\nOur eyes met across a crowded room, and it was love at first sight.\nHe only had eyes for Isabel and was a devoted husband.\nPerhaps not surprisingly, two \u2018eye\u2019 expressions are related to crying. Something that\nbrings a tear to the/your eye\nmakes you cry a little, and if you say of an occasion that there\n[28]<a wasn\u2019t a dry eye in the house/>\n, you mean many people were emotional and crying, usually in response to something such as a speech or a performance:\nThat scene where they say goodbye still brings a tear to my eye.\nThere wasn\u2019t a dry eye in the house during the wedding service.\nSomething that happens\n[29]<a in the blink of an eye/>\nor\n[30]<a in the twinkling of an eye/>\nhappens \u2013 or seems to happen \u2013 extremely quickly:\n[31]<img />\nSearch for:\n[32]<input search;s;Search \u2026;Search for:/>\n[33]<button submit>Search/>\nTop posts\n[34]<a It costs a fortune: talking about high prices/>\n[35]<img />\n[36]<a New words \u2013 24 March 2025/>\n[37]<img />\n[38]<a When life gives you lemons\u2026 (Fruit idioms)/>\n[39]<img />\n[40]<a New words \u2013 17 March 2025/>\n[41]<img />\n[42]<a I would of done it: understanding non-standard grammar forms (2)/>\n[43]<img />\n[44]<a We was hungry: understanding non-standard grammar forms (1)/>\n[45]<img />\nAuthors\n... 3891 pixels below - scroll or extract content to see more ...\nCurrent step: 8/20Current date and time: 2025-03-26 21:58\n"

Your goal is to accomplish the ultimate task following the rules.\n\n# Input Format\nTask\nPrevious steps\nCurrent URL\nOpen Tabs\nInteractive Elements\n[index]<type>text</type>\n- index: Numeric identifier for interaction\n- type: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)\n- text: Element description\nExample:\n[33]<button>Submit Form</button>\n\n- Only elements with numeric indexes in [] are interactive\n- elements without [] provide only context\n\n# Response Rules\n1. RESPONSE FORMAT: You must ALWAYS respond with valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\"current_state\": {\"evaluation_previous_goal\": \"Success|Failed|Unknown - Analyze the current elements and the image to check if the previous goals/actions are successful like intended by the task. Mention if something unexpected happened. Shortly state why/why not\",\n\"memory\": \"Description of what has been done and what you need to remember. Be very specific. Count here ALWAYS how many times you have done something and how many remain. E.g. 0 out of 10 websites analyzed. Continue with abc and xyz\",\n\"next_goal\": \"What needs to be done with the next immediate action\"},\n\"action\":[{\"one_action_name\": {// action-specific parameter}}, // ... more actions in sequence]}\n\n2. ACTIONS: You can specify multiple actions in the list to be executed in sequence. But always specify only one action name per item. Use maximum {max_actions} actions per sequence.\nCommon action sequences:\n- Form filling: [{\"input_text\": {\"index\": 1, \"text\": \"username\"}}, {\"input_text\": {\"index\": 2, \"text\": \"password\"}}, {\"click_element\": {\"index\": 3}}]\n- Navigation and extraction: [{\"go_to_url\": {\"url\": \"https://example.com\"}}, {\"extract_content\": {\"goal\": \"extract the names\"}}]\n- Actions are executed in the given order\n- If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.\n- Only provide the action sequence until an action which changes the page state significantly.\n- Try to be efficient, e.g. fill forms at once, or chain actions where nothing changes on the page\n- only use multiple actions if it makes sense.\n\n3. ELEMENT INTERACTION:\n- Only use indexes of the interactive elements\n- Elements marked with \"[]Non-interactive text\" are non-interactive\n\n4. NAVIGATION & ERROR HANDLING:\n- If no suitable elements exist, use other functions to complete the task\n- If stuck, try alternative approaches - like going back to a previous page, new search, new tab etc.\n- Handle popups/cookies by accepting or closing them\n- Use scroll to find elements you are looking for\n- If you want to research something, open a new tab instead of using the current tab\n- If captcha pops up, try to solve it - else try a different approach\n- If the page is not fully loaded, use wait action\n\n5. TASK COMPLETION:\n- Use the done action as the last action as soon as the ultimate task is complete\n- Dont use \"done\" before you are done with everything the user asked you, except you reach the last step of max_steps. \n- If you reach your last step, use the done action even if the task is not fully finished. Provide all the information you have gathered so far. If the ultimate task is completly finished set success to true. If not everything the user asked for is completed set success in done to false!\n- If you have to do something repeatedly for example the task says for \"each\", or \"for all\", or \"x times\", count always inside \"memory\" how many times you have done it and how many remain. Don't stop until you have completed like the task asked you. Only call done after the last step.\n- Don't hallucinate actions\n- Make sure you include everything you found out for the ultimate task in the done text parameter. Do not just say you are done, but include the requested information of the task. \n\n6. VISUAL CONTEXT:\n- When an image is provided, use it to understand the page layout\n- Bounding boxes with labels on their top right corner correspond to element indexes\n\n7. Form filling:\n- If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often something changed e.g. suggestions popped up under the field.\n\n8. Long tasks:\n- Keep track of the status and subresults in the memory. \n\n9. Extraction:\n- If your task is to find information - call extract_content on the specific pages to get and store the information.\nYour responses must be always JSON with the specified format. ",

Today\u2019s post features \u2018eye\u2019 phrases on a range of themes.\nLet\u2019s start with a couple of romantic expressions. If two strangers\u2019\neyes meet\nacross a crowded room\n, they look at each other in a public place and immediately form a romantic connection. Meanwhile, if someone\n[27]<a only has eyes for/>\none person, they love that person\u00a0romantically and no one else:\nOur eyes met across a crowded room, and it was love at first sight.\nHe only had eyes for Isabel and was a devoted husband.\nPerhaps not surprisingly, two \u2018eye\u2019 expressions are related to crying. Something that\nbrings a tear to the/your eye\nmakes you cry a little, and if you say of an occasion that there\n[28]<a wasn\u2019t a dry eye in the house/>\n, you mean many people were emotional and crying, usually in response to something such as a speech or a performance:\nThat scene where they say goodbye still brings a tear to my eye.\nThere wasn\u2019t a dry eye in the house during the wedding service.\nSomething that happens\n[29]<a in the blink of an eye/>\nor\n[30]<a in the twinkling of an eye/>\nhappens \u2013 or seems to happen \u2013 extremely quickly:\n[31]<img />\nSearch for:\n[32]<input search;s;Search \u2026;Search for:/>\n[33]<button submit>Search/>\nTop posts\n[34]<a It costs a fortune: talking about high prices/>\n[35]<img />\n[36]<a New words \u2013 24 March 2025/>\n[37]<img />\n[38]<a When life gives you lemons\u2026 (Fruit idioms)/>\n[39]<img />\n[40]<a New words \u2013 17 March 2025/>\n[41]<img />\n[42]<a I would of done it: understanding non-standard grammar forms (2)/>\n[43]<img />\n[44]<a We was hungry: understanding non-standard grammar forms (1)/>\n[45]<img />\nAuthors\n... 3891 pixels below - scroll or extract content to see more ...\nCurrent step: 9/20Current date and time: 2025-03-26 21:58\n"

Your goal is to accomplish the ultimate task following the rules.\n\n# Input Format\nTask\nPrevious steps\nCurrent URL\nOpen Tabs\nInteractive Elements\n[index]<type>text</type>\n- index: Numeric identifier for interaction\n- type: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)\n- text: Element description\nExample:\n[33]<button>Submit Form</button>\n\n- Only elements with numeric indexes in [] are interactive\n- elements without [] provide only context\n\n# Response Rules\n1. RESPONSE FORMAT: You must ALWAYS respond with valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\"current_state\": {\"evaluation_previous_goal\": \"Success|Failed|Unknown - Analyze the current elements and the image to check if the previous goals/actions are successful like intended by the task. Mention if something unexpected happened. Shortly state why/why not\",\n\"memory\": \"Description of what has been done and what you need to remember. Be very specific. Count here ALWAYS how many times you have done something and how many remain. E.g. 0 out of 10 websites analyzed. Continue with abc and xyz\",\n\"next_goal\": \"What needs to be done with the next immediate action\"},\n\"action\":[{\"one_action_name\": {// action-specific parameter}}, // ... more actions in sequence]}\n\n2. ACTIONS: You can specify multiple actions in the list to be executed in sequence. But always specify only one action name per item. Use maximum {max_actions} actions per sequence.\nCommon action sequences:\n- Form filling: [{\"input_text\": {\"index\": 1, \"text\": \"username\"}}, {\"input_text\": {\"index\": 2, \"text\": \"password\"}}, {\"click_element\": {\"index\": 3}}]\n- Navigation and extraction: [{\"go_to_url\": {\"url\": \"https://example.com\"}}, {\"extract_content\": {\"goal\": \"extract the names\"}}]\n- Actions are executed in the given order\n- If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.\n- Only provide the action sequence until an action which changes the page state significantly.\n- Try to be efficient, e.g. fill forms at once, or chain actions where nothing changes on the page\n- only use multiple actions if it makes sense.\n\n3. ELEMENT INTERACTION:\n- Only use indexes of the interactive elements\n- Elements marked with \"[]Non-interactive text\" are non-interactive\n\n4. NAVIGATION & ERROR HANDLING:\n- If no suitable elements exist, use other functions to complete the task\n- If stuck, try alternative approaches - like going back to a previous page, new search, new tab etc.\n- Handle popups/cookies by accepting or closing them\n- Use scroll to find elements you are looking for\n- If you want to research something, open a new tab instead of using the current tab\n- If captcha pops up, try to solve it - else try a different approach\n- If the page is not fully loaded, use wait action\n\n5. TASK COMPLETION:\n- Use the done action as the last action as soon as the ultimate task is complete\n- Dont use \"done\" before you are done with everything the user asked you, except you reach the last step of max_steps. \n- If you reach your last step, use the done action even if the task is not fully finished. Provide all the information you have gathered so far. If the ultimate task is completly finished set success to true. If not everything the user asked for is completed set success in done to false!\n- If you have to do something repeatedly for example the task says for \"each\", or \"for all\", or \"x times\", count always inside \"memory\" how many times you have done it and how many remain. Don't stop until you have completed like the task asked you. Only call done after the last step.\n- Don't hallucinate actions\n- Make sure you include everything you found out for the ultimate task in the done text parameter. Do not just say you are done, but include the requested information of the task. \n\n6. VISUAL CONTEXT:\n- When an image is provided, use it to understand the page layout\n- Bounding boxes with labels on their top right corner correspond to element indexes\n\n7. Form filling:\n- If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often something changed e.g. suggestions popped up under the field.\n\n8. Long tasks:\n- Keep track of the status and subresults in the memory. \n\n9. Extraction:\n- If your task is to find information - call extract_content on the specific pages to get and store the information.\nYour responses must be always JSON with the specified format. ",

Today\u2019s post features \u2018eye\u2019 phrases on a range of themes.\nLet\u2019s start with a couple of romantic expressions. If two strangers\u2019\neyes meet\nacross a crowded room\n, they look at each other in a public place and immediately form a romantic connection. Meanwhile, if someone\n[27]<a only has eyes for/>\none person, they love that person\u00a0romantically and no one else:\nOur eyes met across a crowded room, and it was love at first sight.\nHe only had eyes for Isabel and was a devoted husband.\nPerhaps not surprisingly, two \u2018eye\u2019 expressions are related to crying.

              "content": "You are an AI agent designed to automate browser tasks. Your goal is to accomplish the ultimate task following the rules.\n\n# Input Format\nTask\nPrevious steps\nCurrent URL\nOpen Tabs\nInteractive Elements\n[index]<type>text</type>\n- index: Numeric identifier for interaction\n- type: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)\n- text: Element description\nExample:\n[33]<button>Submit Form</button>\n\n- Only elements with numeric indexes in [] are interactive\n- elements without [] provide only context\n\n# Response Rules\n1. RESPONSE FORMAT: You must ALWAYS respond with valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\"current_state\": {\"evaluation_previous_goal\": \"Success|Failed|Unknown - Analyze the current elements and the image to check if the previous goals/actions are successful like intended by the task. Mention if something unexpected happened. Shortly state why/why not\",\n\"memory\": \"Description of what has been done and what you need to remember. Be very specific. Count here ALWAYS how many times you have done something and how many remain. E.g. 0 out of 10 websites analyzed. Continue with abc and xyz\",\n\"next_goal\": \"What needs to be done with the next immediate action\"},\n\"action\":[{\"one_action_name\": {// action-specific parameter}}, // ... more actions in sequence]}\n\n2. ACTIONS: You can specify multiple actions in the list to be executed in sequence. But always specify only one action name per item. Use maximum {max_actions} actions per sequence.\nCommon action sequences:\n- Form filling: [{\"input_text\": {\"index\": 1, \"text\": \"username\"}}, {\"input_text\": {\"index\": 2, \"text\": \"password\"}}, {\"click_element\": {\"index\": 3}}]\n- Navigation and extraction: [{\"go_to_url\": {\"url\": \"https://example.com\"}}, {\"extract_content\": {\"goal\": \"extract the names\"}}]\n- Actions are executed in the given order\n- If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.\n- Only provide the action sequence until an action which changes the page state significantly.\n- Try to be efficient, e.g. fill forms at once, or chain actions where nothing changes on the page\n- only use multiple actions if it makes sense.\n\n3. ELEMENT INTERACTION:\n- Only use indexes of the interactive elements\n- Elements marked with \"[]Non-interactive text\" are non-interactive\n\n4. NAVIGATION & ERROR HANDLING:\n- If no suitable elements exist, use other functions to complete the task\n- If stuck, try alternative approaches - like going back to a previous page, new search, new tab etc.\n- Handle popups/cookies by accepting or closing them\n- Use scroll to find elements you are looking for\n- If you want to research something, open a new tab instead of using the current tab\n- If captcha pops up, try to solve it - else try a different approach\n- If the page is not fully loaded, use wait action\n\n5. TASK COMPLETION:\n- Use the done action as the last action as soon as the ultimate task is complete\n- Dont use \"done\" before you are done with everything the user asked you, except you reach the last step of max_steps. \n- If you reach your last step, use the done action even if the task is not fully finished. Provide all the information you have gathered so far. If the ultimate task is completly finished set success to true. If not everything the user asked for is completed set success in done to false!\n- If you have to do something repeatedly for example the task says for \"each\", or \"for all\", or \"x times\", count always inside \"memory\" how many times you have done it and how many remain. Don't stop until you have completed like the task asked you. Only call done after the last step.\n- Don't hallucinate actions\n- Make sure you include everything you found out for the ultimate task in the done text parameter. Do not just say you are done, but include the requested information of the task. \n\n6. VISUAL CONTEXT:\n- When an image is provided, use it to understand the page layout\n- Bounding boxes with labels on their top right corner correspond to element indexes\n\n7. Form filling:\n- If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often something changed e.g. suggestions popped up under the field.\n\n8. Long tasks:\n- Keep track of the status and subresults in the memory. \n\n9. Extraction:\n- If your task is to find information - call extract_content on the specific pages to get and store the information.\nYour responses must be always JSON with the specified format. ",

Today\u2019s post features \u2018eye\u2019 phrases on a range of themes.\nLet\u2019s start with a couple of romantic expressions. If two strangers\u2019\neyes meet\nacross a crowded room\n, they look at each other in a public place and immediately form a romantic connection. Meanwhile, if someone\n[27]<a only has eyes for/>\none person, they love that person\u00a0romantically and no one else:\nOur eyes met across a crowded room, and it was love at first sight.\nHe only had eyes for Isabel and was a devoted husband.\nPerhaps not surprisingly, two \u2018eye\u2019 expressions are related to crying. Something that\nbrings a tear to the/your eye\nmakes you cry a little, and if you say of an occasion that there\n[28]<a wasn\u2019t a dry eye in the house/>\n, you mean many people were emotional and crying, usually in response to something such as a speech or a performance:\nThat scene where they say goodbye still brings a tear to my eye.\nThere wasn\u2019t a dry eye in the house during the wedding service.\nSomething that happens\n[29]<a in the blink of an eye/>\nor\n[30]<a in the twinkling of an eye/>\nhappens \u2013 or seems to happen \u2013 extremely quickly:\n[31]<img />\nSearch for:\n[32]<input search;s;Search \u2026;Search for:/>\n[33]<button submit>Search/>\nTop posts\n[34]<a It costs a fortune: talking about high prices/>\n[35]<img />\n[36]<a New words \u2013 24 March 2025/>\n[37]<img />\n[38]<a When life gives you lemons\u2026 (Fruit idioms)/>\n[39]<img />\n[40]<a New words \u2013 17 March 2025/>\n[41]<img />\n[42]<a I would of done it: understanding non-standard grammar forms (2)/>\n[43]<img />\n[44]<a We was hungry: understanding non-standard grammar forms (1)/>\n[45]<img />\nAuthors\n... 3891 pixels below - scroll or extract content to see more ...\nCurrent step: 12/20Current date and time: 2025-03-26 21:59\n"

              "content": "You are an AI agent designed to automate browser tasks. Your goal is to accomplish the ultimate task following the rules.\n\n# Input Format\nTask\nPrevious steps\nCurrent URL\nOpen Tabs\nInteractive Elements\n[index]<type>text</type>\n- index: Numeric identifier for interaction\n- type: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)\n- text: Element description\nExample:\n[33]<button>Submit Form</button>\n\n- Only elements with numeric indexes in [] are interactive\n- elements without [] provide only context\n\n# Response Rules\n1. RESPONSE FORMAT: You must ALWAYS respond with valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\"current_state\": {\"evaluation_previous_goal\": \"Success|Failed|Unknown - Analyze the current elements and the image to check if the previous goals/actions are successful like intended by the task. Mention if something unexpected happened. Shortly state why/why not\",\n\"memory\": \"Description of what has been done and what you need to remember. Be very specific. Count here ALWAYS how many times you have done something and how many remain. E.g. 0 out of 10 websites analyzed. Continue with abc and xyz\",\n\"next_goal\": \"What needs to be done with the next immediate action\"},\n\"action\":[{\"one_action_name\": {// action-specific parameter}}, // ... more actions in sequence]}\n\n2. ACTIONS: You can specify multiple actions in the list to be executed in sequence. But always specify only one action name per item. Use maximum {max_actions} actions per sequence.\nCommon action sequences:\n- Form filling: [{\"input_text\": {\"index\": 1, \"text\": \"username\"}}, {\"input_text\": {\"index\": 2, \"text\": \"password\"}}, {\"click_element\": {\"index\": 3}}]\n- Navigation and extraction: [{\"go_to_url\": {\"url\": \"https://example.com\"}}, {\"extract_content\": {\"goal\": \"extract the names\"}}]\n- Actions are executed in the given order\n- If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.\n- Only provide the action sequence until an action which changes the page state significantly.\n- Try to be efficient, e.g. fill forms at once, or chain actions where nothing changes on the page\n- only use multiple actions if it makes sense.\n\n3. ELEMENT INTERACTION:\n- Only use indexes of the interactive elements\n- Elements marked with \"[]Non-interactive text\" are non-interactive\n\n4. NAVIGATION & ERROR HANDLING:\n- If no suitable elements exist, use other functions to complete the task\n- If stuck, try alternative approaches - like going back to a previous page, new search, new tab etc.\n- Handle popups/cookies by accepting or closing them\n- Use scroll to find elements you are looking for\n- If you want to research something, open a new tab instead of using the current tab\n- If captcha pops up, try to solve it - else try a different approach\n- If the page is not fully loaded, use wait action\n\n5. TASK COMPLETION:\n- Use the done action as the last action as soon as the ultimate task is complete\n- Dont use \"done\" before you are done with everything the user asked you, except you reach the last step of max_steps. \n- If you reach your last step, use the done action even if the task is not fully finished. Provide all the information you have gathered so far. If the ultimate task is completly finished set success to true. If not everything the user asked for is completed set success in done to false!\n- If you have to do something repeatedly for example the task says for \"each\", or \"for all\", or \"x times\", count always inside \"memory\" how many times you have done it and how many remain. Don't stop until you have completed like the task asked you. Only call done after the last step.\n- Don't hallucinate actions\n- Make sure you include everything you found out for the ultimate task in the done text parameter. Do not just say you are done, but include the requested information of the task. \n\n6. VISUAL CONTEXT:\n- When an image is provided, use it to understand the page layout\n- Bounding boxes with labels on their top right corner correspond to element indexes\n\n7. Form filling:\n- If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often something changed e.g. suggestions popped up under the field.\n\n8. Long tasks:\n- Keep track of the status and subresults in the memory. \n\n9. Extraction:\n- If your task is to find information - call extract_content on the specific pages to get and store the information.\nYour responses must be always JSON with the specified format. ",

Today\u2019s post features \u2018eye\u2019 phrases on a range of themes.\nLet\u2019s start with a couple of romantic expressions. If two strangers\u2019\neyes meet\nacross a crowded room\n, they look at each other in a public place and immediately form a romantic connection. Meanwhile, if someone\n[27]<a only has eyes for/>\none person, they love that person\u00a0romantically and no one else:\nOur eyes met across a crowded room, and it was love at first sight.\nHe only had eyes for Isabel and was a devoted husband.\nPerhaps not surprisingly, two \u2018eye\u2019 expressions are related to crying. Something that\nbrings a tear to the/your eye\nmakes you cry a little, and if you say of an occasion that there\n[28]<a wasn\u2019t a dry eye in the house/>\n, you mean many people were emotional and crying, usually in response to something such as a speech or a performance:\nThat scene where they say goodbye still brings a tear to my eye.\nThere wasn\u2019t a dry eye in the house during the wedding service.\nSomething that happens\n[29]<a in the blink of an eye/>\nor\n[30]<a in the twinkling of an eye/>\nhappens \u2013 or seems to happen \u2013 extremely quickly:\n[31]<img />\nSearch for:\n[32]<input search;s;Search \u2026;Search for:/>\n[33]<button submit>Search/>\nTop posts\n[34]<a It costs a fortune: talking about high prices/>\n[35]<img />\n[36]<a New words \u2013 24 March 2025/>\n[37]<img />\n[38]<a When life gives you lemons\u2026 (Fruit idioms)/>\n[39]<img />\n[40]<a New words \u2013 17 March 2025/>\n[41]<img />\n[42]<a I would of done it: understanding non-standard grammar forms (2)/>\n[43]<img />\n[44]<a We was hungry: understanding non-standard grammar forms (1)/>\n[45]<img />\nAuthors\n... 3891 pixels below - scroll or extract content to see more ...\nCurrent step: 13/20Current date and time: 2025-03-26 21:59\n"

              "content": "You are an AI agent designed to automate browser tasks. Your goal is to accomplish the ultimate task following the rules.\n\n# Input Format\nTask\nPrevious steps\nCurrent URL\nOpen Tabs\nInteractive Elements\n[index]<type>text</type>\n- index: Numeric identifier for interaction\n- type: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)\n- text: Element description\nExample:\n[33]<button>Submit Form</button>\n\n- Only elements with numeric indexes in [] are interactive\n- elements without [] provide only context\n\n# Response Rules\n1. RESPONSE FORMAT: You must ALWAYS respond with valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\"current_state\": {\"evaluation_previous_goal\": \"Success|Failed|Unknown - Analyze the current elements and the image to check if the previous goals/actions are successful like intended by the task. Mention if something unexpected happened. Shortly state why/why not\",\n\"memory\": \"Description of what has been done and what you need to remember. Be very specific. Count here ALWAYS how many times you have done something and how many remain. E.g. 0 out of 10 websites analyzed. Continue with abc and xyz\",\n\"next_goal\": \"What needs to be done with the next immediate action\"},\n\"action\":[{\"one_action_name\": {// action-specific parameter}}, // ... more actions in sequence]}\n\n2. ACTIONS: You can specify multiple actions in the list to be executed in sequence. But always specify only one action name per item. Use maximum {max_actions} actions per sequence.\nCommon action sequences:\n- Form filling: [{\"input_text\": {\"index\": 1, \"text\": \"username\"}}, {\"input_text\": {\"index\": 2, \"text\": \"password\"}}, {\"click_element\": {\"index\": 3}}]\n- Navigation and extraction: [{\"go_to_url\": {\"url\": \"https://example.com\"}}, {\"extract_content\": {\"goal\": \"extract the names\"}}]\n- Actions are executed in the given order\n- If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.\n- Only provide the action sequence until an action which changes the page state significantly.\n- Try to be efficient, e.g. fill forms at once, or chain actions where nothing changes on the page\n- only use multiple actions if it makes sense.\n\n3. ELEMENT INTERACTION:\n- Only use indexes of the interactive elements\n- Elements marked with \"[]Non-interactive text\" are non-interactive\n\n4. NAVIGATION & ERROR HANDLING:\n- If no suitable elements exist, use other functions to complete the task\n- If stuck, try alternative approaches - like going back to a previous page, new search, new tab etc.\n- Handle popups/cookies by accepting or closing them\n- Use scroll to find elements you are looking for\n- If you want to research something, open a new tab instead of using the current tab\n- If captcha pops up, try to solve it - else try a different approach\n- If the page is not fully loaded, use wait action\n\n5. TASK COMPLETION:\n- Use the done action as the last action as soon as the ultimate task is complete\n- Dont use \"done\" before you are done with everything the user asked you, except you reach the last step of max_steps. \n- If you reach your last step, use the done action even if the task is not fully finished. Provide all the information you have gathered so far. If the ultimate task is completly finished set success to true. If not everything the user asked for is completed set success in done to false!\n- If you have to do something repeatedly for example the task says for \"each\", or \"for all\", or \"x times\", count always inside \"memory\" how many times you have done it and how many remain. Don't stop until you have completed like the task asked you. Only call done after the last step.\n- Don't hallucinate actions\n- Make sure you include everything you found out for the ultimate task in the done text parameter. Do not just say you are done, but include the requested information of the task. \n\n6. VISUAL CONTEXT:\n- When an image is provided, use it to understand the page layout\n- Bounding boxes with labels on their top right corner correspond to element indexes\n\n7. Form filling:\n- If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often something changed e.g. suggestions popped up under the field.\n\n8. Long tasks:\n- Keep track of the status and subresults in the memory. \n\n9. Extraction:\n- If your task is to find information - call extract_content on the specific pages to get and store the information.\nYour responses must be always JSON with the specified format. ",

Your goal is to accomplish the ultimate task following the rules.\n\n# Input Format\nTask\nPrevious steps\nCurrent URL\nOpen Tabs\nInteractive Elements\n[index]<type>text</type>\n- index: Numeric identifier for interaction\n- type: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)\n- text: Element description\nExample:\n[33]<button>Submit Form</button>\n\n- Only elements with numeric indexes in [] are interactive\n- elements without [] provide only context\n\n# Response Rules\n1. RESPONSE FORMAT: You must ALWAYS respond with valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\"current_state\": {\"evaluation_previous_goal\": \"Success|Failed|Unknown - Analyze the current elements and the image to check if the previous goals/actions are successful like intended by the task. Mention if something unexpected happened. Shortly state why/why not\",\n\"memory\": \"Description of what has been done and what you need to remember. Be very specific. Count here ALWAYS how many times you have done something and how many remain. E.g. 0 out of 10 websites analyzed. Continue with abc and xyz\",\n\"next_goal\": \"What needs to be done with the next immediate action\"},\n\"action\":[{\"one_action_name\": {// action-specific parameter}}, // ... more actions in sequence]}\n\n2. ACTIONS: You can specify multiple actions in the list to be executed in sequence. But always specify only one action name per item. Use maximum {max_actions} actions per sequence.\nCommon action sequences:\n- Form filling: [{\"input_text\": {\"index\": 1, \"text\": \"username\"}}, {\"input_text\": {\"index\": 2, \"text\": \"password\"}}, {\"click_element\": {\"index\": 3}}]\n- Navigation and extraction: [{\"go_to_url\": {\"url\": \"https://example.com\"}}, {\"extract_content\": {\"goal\": \"extract the names\"}}]\n- Actions are executed in the given order\n- If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.\n- Only provide the action sequence until an action which changes the page state significantly.\n- Try to be efficient, e.g. fill forms at once, or chain actions where nothing changes on the page\n- only use multiple actions if it makes sense.\n\n3. ELEMENT INTERACTION:\n- Only use indexes of the interactive elements\n- Elements marked with \"[]Non-interactive text\" are non-interactive\n\n4. NAVIGATION & ERROR HANDLING:\n- If no suitable elements exist, use other functions to complete the task\n- If stuck, try alternative approaches - like going back to a previous page, new search, new tab etc.\n- Handle popups/cookies by accepting or closing them\n- Use scroll to find elements you are looking for\n- If you want to research something, open a new tab instead of using the current tab\n- If captcha pops up, try to solve it - else try a different approach\n- If the page is not fully loaded, use wait action\n\n5. TASK COMPLETION:\n- Use the done action as the last action as soon as the ultimate task is complete\n- Dont use \"done\" before you are done with everything the user asked you, except you reach the last step of max_steps. \n- If you reach your last step, use the done action even if the task is not fully finished. Provide all the information you have gathered so far. If the ultimate task is completly finished set success to true. If not everything the user asked for is completed set success in done to false!\n- If you have to do something repeatedly for example the task says for \"each\", or \"for all\", or \"x times\", count always inside \"memory\" how many times you have done it and how many remain. Don't stop until you have completed like the task asked you. Only call done after the last step.\n- Don't hallucinate actions\n- Make sure you include everything you found out for the ultimate task in the done text parameter. Do not just say you are done, but include the requested information of the task. \n\n6. VISUAL CONTEXT:\n- When an image is provided, use it to understand the page layout\n- Bounding boxes with labels on their top right corner correspond to element indexes\n\n7. Form filling:\n- If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often something changed e.g. suggestions popped up under the field.\n\n8. Long tasks:\n- Keep track of the status and subresults in the memory. \n\n9. Extraction:\n- If your task is to find information - call extract_content on the specific pages to get and store the information.\nYour responses must be always JSON with the specified format. ",
